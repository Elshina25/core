&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 13 September 2013 - Prime &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.rentnow.ru/en/services/index.php?c=2&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;office&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; rents in Dublin increased for consecutive quarters in the first half of 2013 (H1), the first time in six years the market has recorded growth. In the second quarter (Q2) prime rents in Dublin increased by 5.3% potentially indicative of an accelerating city office market recovery, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Dublin&amp;rsquo;s prime rental market contrasts to most other EMEA markets where rents have typically remained flat over the first half of the year. Dublin has benefited from healthy levels of leasing activity this year with transactions across Q1 totaling over 400,500 sq ft, driven by its emergence as a technology hub (nine of the biggest ten technology companies are based in Ireland), low corporation tax rates and a burgeoning workforce which is young, educated and English speaking. Dublin’s rental growth is also responding to very low levels of available prime space across the city allied to a lack of office development during the financial downturn.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Office take-up levels in Dublin has also improved, exceeding 725,000 sq ft in H1 marking a 23% increase year-on-year, with evidence suggesting demand remains strong, particularly from the telecoms and technology (T&amp;amp;amp;T) sector. Twitter, currently occupying serviced offices in Dublin, is looking for approximately 30,000 sq ft in the city and Facebook has stated its intention to recruit an additional 100 staff to its premises in Dublin Docklands. Such activity, alongside other recent deals including Investec securing 25,750 sq ft, Bloomberg taking 12,000 sq ft and Samsung agreeing terms on 9,000 sq ft is aiding growth in the city.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The aggregate trend across EMEA’s office markets has also improved, following a weaker first quarter of 2013, with an increase of 11.8% compared to Q1 and by 4% on the same quarter of last year. This turnaround has been helped by a pick-up in demand across a few select regions, namely Germany’s five core markets, boosted further by London and Moscow’s quarterly take up reaching around the 3.5 million sq ft mark, by far the highest level recorded in the markets since 2011. In contrast specific markets, including Paris and Madrid, have suffered from occupier caution with companies reluctant to commit to new leases or consume the capital costs of relocating, whilst the macro-economic climate remains uncertain. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mark Caskey, Head of Global Corporate Services, CORE.XP, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Recent positive economic news appears to be boosting occupier confidence with total office take-up levels across EMEA improving markedly on Q1, with real momentum coming to the fore in some key markets, particularly Dublin. Whilst occupiers remain focused on cost management and wait for the wider economic climate to become clearer, this news is encouraging.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Since the last quarter of 2012 we have also seen an emerging trend of increased leasing activity and take-up by T&amp;amp;amp;T companies across Europe, with demand outstripping that of the banking and finance sector for the first time. We believe the T&amp;amp;amp;T sector will continue to be one of the engines of economic growth and as the war for talent intensifies occupiers will gravitate towards established tech hubs driving prime rents in the process, as cited by Dublin.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Recent news from the Eurozone economy increased probability of current recession to end in a few coming quarters. Unfortunately, they were not supported by the Russian statistics, claiming that GDP growth significantly decreased in H1 2013. Worsened economic expectations influenced adversely companies’ business sentiments and development plans. In this regard we expect to see just around 10% or even smaller growth in take up in 2013.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s new research reveals the key drivers of Moscow region Industrial Big Box market. In its report CORE.XP compares Moscow with Paris, Prague, and Warsaw. Other key logistics destinations, such as Helsinki, Copenhagen and Madrid are not perfect benchmarks, as these cities are powerful transport and logistic hubs, and warehouse market in these destinations serves logistics traffic across the whole Europe. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Currently Moscow has one of the lowest warehouse space penetration - 1,57 sq m – among other European destinations, according to the latest data by CORE.XP. Typical warehouse space per 1 sq m of retail in Europe, in the cities such as Warsaw, Prague and Paris, is in range of 1,8 - 2,7 sq m.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 By the end of 1H 2013 Moscow retail space penetration rate was around 325 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants. To compare, in the majority of the European capitals this indicator on average is around 500 sq m per 1000 inhabitants. The total amount of the modern retail space announced to be delivered in 2014-2015 is close to 1,4 mln. sq m. As a result, in the coming years we may witness historical high yearly new delivery of around 600 thous. sq.m. of the quality retail space. In next 3-4 years Moscow may reach retail space penetration rates of selected European capitals. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Existing high current demand for warehouse space is a result of 2 factors. The first one is insufficient supply to cover the needs of the existing retail space operators. The second one comes from the expected volumes of new deliveries of retail schemes in 2013-2015. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Potential &amp;ldquo;not yet met&amp;rdquo; market demand for warehouse space is estimated at 3,1 – 3,5 mln.sq.m. With this amount delivered the market will switch from current “developers’ market” to the “tenants’ market” stage, i.e. will become mature. It means that in the next 3-4 years we will gradual decrease in yearly delivery of the new warehouse space from current around 1 mln. sq. m. to 0.6 – 0.7 mln. sq.m.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Market transition to maturity will lead to increase tenants’ demand to the I&amp;amp;amp;L space quality and possible growth in the vacancy rates. &#13;

 “There’s no doubt that our report does not provide a 100% guaranteed right response to the question “When will the Moscow I&amp;amp;amp;L property market reach its saturation phase?”. Nonetheless, we have developed a methodology that can more or less predict that the market is moving in that direction, at least 18 months or so before it happens. Given the length of the “big box” construction cycle, this planning tool can be helpful for developers because it allows them to better gauge the needed supply versus future demand for large blocks of space in the coming years.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 CORE.XP’s quarterly ranking (Q2 2013) of the top 10 prime global retail markets saw little change relative to previous quarters; however, four of the top 10 markets - New York, London, Zurich and Tokyo - saw quarterly increases in prime retail rents, compared with only one market during the previous quarter. Historically low construction levels and fierce retailer competition for the best locations is fuelling this growth, leading to record-breaking rents in many global markets. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Hong Kong (US$4,328 per sq ft per annum) tops the rankings by a substantial margin, with New York ($3,050 per sq ft per annum) in second position posting prime rents $1,200 per sq ft below Hong Kong. Similarly, a large spread of more than $1,800 per sq ft per annum exists between New York and third-ranked Paris ($1,220 per sq ft per annum). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Despite its high rents, retailers continue to establish a presence in Hong Kong, seeking to benefit from the market’s growing luxury retail scene. According to CORE.XP research, 51 new retailers opened stores in Hong Kong last year and the city has the highest representation of luxury retailers of all global markets. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

 Joe Lin, Executive Director Retail, Hong Kong, CORE.XP, commented: &#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Healthy tourist arrivals and lack of available space make finding an adequate unit in Hong Kong’s prime retail locations a major challenge for new and existing retailers. Units in prime locations with reasonable shop fronts and size rarely become available, leaving retailers with few choices. As such, preference for spaces with these characteristics continues to generate strong demand, supporting the market’s high - and rising - prime rent levels.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 New York displayed a 2.7% quarterly growth rate in prime retail rent levels, signifying a 22% annual increase relative to last year. Demand from international retailers remains strong in New York and tourism levels continue to drive strong retail sales activity. &#13;

In particular, the supply and demand imbalance on New Bond Street and Old Bond Street resulted in prime rents for Central London increasing by 9.1% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year, as measured in local currency. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Preference for prime space continues to impact prime rents in Zurich ($896 per sq ft per annum) where rents increased 2.2% quarter-over-quarter and 5.6% year-over-year. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The tight supply of prime space, as well as the gradually strengthening confidence of occupiers contributed to a 2.0% quarter-over-quarter local currency rental increase in Tokyo. Viewed as the gateway to Asia by many foreign retailers, competition for prime locations across Tokyo remained fierce. Domestic retailers have also expanded, with some Osaka-based retailers expanding their presence in the city for the first time. &#13;

 “Consumer demand and confidence conditions have notably improved thanks to a strengthening economy. Luxury retailers noted a positive push in demand for brand items, which have been recording high sales values in department stores since the beginning of the year.” &#13;

 Prime rents in Sydney ($945 per sq ft), Melbourne ($794 per sq ft), and Brisbane ($599 per sq ft), held steady this quarter despite flat retail turnover figures. &#13;

 “Australia has continued to benefit from low vacancy rates and the limited new supply coming to the market. The influx of international retailers has also continued with both Brooks Brothers from the US and Marks &amp;amp;amp; Spencer from the UK recently announcing they would enter Australia. &#13;

 “Another consideration is the upcoming Federal election. History shows that retail sales following a Federal election usually show a strong short-term spike a consumer confidence lifts and this will translate to rental growth over the next 12 months. This will also coincide with a number of the &amp;lsquo;boom time’ leases of 2008/2009 coming up for their five year anniversary.” &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Rental rates in Moscow street retail remain stable due to the majority of new brands entering the Russian market through popular shopping malls. In 2014-2015 the market will see a few new landmark schemes, which will strengthen competition for tenants with street retail format. As a result, we do not expect to see notable changes in the hi-street rental rates in the nearest future.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investor focus is largely concentrated on Russia and Poland (together accounting for €1.7 billion) &amp;ndash; especially for major dominant shopping centres. Above average growth perspectives are reflected in the retail pipelines for both countries. Moscow&amp;rsquo;s retail pipeline is strong with around 1.6 million square metres currently under construction, while Poland’s pipeline is also considerable with close to 1 million sq m under construction. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Outside Poland and Russia, investor interest is more focused on smaller and therefore less capital-intensive types of retail such as supermarket-led schemes or stand-alone units. As investors are reworking portfolios, active trading of partial interests is being seen across the region. A recent example is the sale of the remaining shares in Zlote Tarasy in Warsaw from the City of Warsaw to Unibail-Rodamco. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Short term improvements in sentiment, more positive retail sales data, reduced development pipelines - beyond Poland and Russia - and retailer expansion interest in CEE, may be seen as signals that growth will remain visible on CEE’s retail market. Unless there are significant changes to the macro-economic situation – trading in the second half of the year will remain strong. This may bring 2013 investment activity up to the levels seen in 2008.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Interest in CEE retail assets has remained strong since 2011 and the limitations on deal flow are mainly the result of a reduced development pipeline. Institutional investors with a long-term holding strategy have acquired over time a significant portion of prime stock in CEE’s major cities. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Major investors such as Unibail-Rodamco, ECE and Atrium ERE - have taken out a significant portion of the prime CEE retail stock from being offered in the short-term and therefore affect liquidity in this segment of the market. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “However, the pipeline is changing from large-scale green field development to focus on more tailored development. Older schemes are being updated and extended, which provides relief for the limited pipeline. The interest in this type of value-add retail was confirmed by the signing of the Charter Hall-portfolio in Poland, comprising of assets in major Polish cities in more suburban locations – this deal is expected to close during H2 2013.” &#13;

 “It was in H1 2013 when Russian commercial real estate market almost set up a new annual historical high in terms of volumes of investments in the retail properties. It occurred due to transactions with shopping malls “Metropolis” in Moscow and “Aura” in Novosibirsk. In H2 2013 investments in the retail properties may further increase by 50% and reach USD 3.3 bln. mark by the end of the year. Developers are also very active in this segment: we might see a new historical delivery high in 2014.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investment in the retail properties is the best bet on the recovery of the world economy, as it will be the least suffered segment in the Russian CRE market if recovery would not happen. That is why we register high investors’ activity despite the fact the economies of the both Russia and Eurozone are showing the worst rates of GDP growth in the recent several years.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;border: 0px none; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px; padding: 5px 0px 10px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Moscow, 5 August 2013 &amp;ndash; The key feature of H1 2013 was the real deficit of quality supply, according to a new report from CORE.XP Russia Industrial and Logistics Research. According to the report over 70% of the premises that are in the pipeline for H2 2013 are already pre-let or pre-sold. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 During H1 2013 consumers preferred to lease rather than purchase warehouse premises. Take-up in H1 amounted to almost 450 thousand sq m, which is 7.5% lower compared to H1 2012. Though, demand exceeded supply by 1.8 times in H1 2013. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 About 76% of the deals were based on pre-lease format. 23 % of the H1 delivery in 2013 was based on build-to-suit format. However take-up structure is likely to change in H2 2013. Demand will follow supply structure; share of BTS projects in the total new delivery will grow. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Demand structure by business sectors in H1 2013 did not change from the previous quarter. Traditionally, a group of leaders included retailers, which took 30% from the total take-up, and distributors (29%) and logistics companies (21%).  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Completions in H1 2013 amounted to 250 thousand sq m of Class A warehouse space that is 28% lower compared to the first half of 2012.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Just a few warehouse projects were put in operation in Q2 2013 among which are production warehouse complex Leshkovo, 14 km from MKAD on Novorizhskoe highway, and industrial park PNK-Vnukovo, 19 km from MKAD on Borovskoe highway. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Despite clear deficit of the vacant space rental rates remain stable within range of $125-140 per sq m per annum (excluding VAT and operational expenses), and vacancy rate remains on the same level for a year in the range of 1,06%. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 However, 720,000 sq m of class A warehouses are to be delivered by the end of 2013 in the Moscow Region, and that is twice as much as was in H2 2012. Thus, the total amount of warehouse space to be delivered in 2013 will reach 970 thousand sq m, and will reach the highest level since 2007, when more than 1.5 mln sq m of class A warehouse space were put into operation. &#13;

 Vasiliy Grigoriev, Analyst of Industrial and Logistics Market, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, comments: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Though new deliveries in the I&amp;amp;amp;L segment are typical for a boom stage, nevertheless, market players are quite cautious and deliberate. Developers prefer BTS projects or construction for a known client, avoiding large speculative schemes. Tenants and purchasers of warehouses which rent space for own needs start negotiations 6-9 months in advance, to ensure that they will have warehouse space by the required date. Majority of the newly building space is absorbed already at the construction stage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Supply gradually grows up to the demand levels. As a result, players both on the demand and supply sides are quite comfortable with the current market status-quo&amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

 In Q2 2013 the retail sector was the most popular with investment volumes totalling 860 million USD, accounting for 62% of the total volume of registered investment. This trend is supported by high activity in development. As a result of the latter, in 2014 we might see the record high new delivery. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The volume of registered investment in office real estate amounted to 314 million USD, or about 22% of total investment. This expected decrease of investments in the office properties can be explained by some lack of the available investment targets. Investors in offices are a bit reluctant to leave CBD (especially CBD Prime). &#13;

 Investment activity both in Europe and Russia explicitly highlights that investors bet on the fact that currently economies are passing by their &amp;ldquo;troughs&amp;rdquo;, and in the late 2013 – early 2014 we will see economic upturn.  &#13;

 “In H2 2013 investors’ activity will somewhat decrease as a result of the deficit of good investment targets offered for sale. Investors will still keep focusing on retail and office properties. According to our estimates, 2013 volume of investments in the Russian commercial real estate may amount to USD 5.5 – 6 bn with 10-20% growth compared to 2012” &#13;

 Germany continues to be one of the strongest investment markets in Europe, benefitting from both strong demand from domestic investors and growing interest from around the world. In aggregate, in the last four quarters, Germany has seen €28.4 billion of commercial real estate investment, an increase of 36% on the previous twelve months. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Sweden and Norway also made significant contributions to the growth in quarterly investment activity. Both countries have seen strong investment activity for several quarters now. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Property investment was at moderate levels relative to Q2 2012 in both the UK and France. In the case of the UK, the fall in activity was only 6.5%. In recent years, property investment in France has been strongly weighted to the second half of the year and therefore it will be interesting to see whether that pattern is repeated in 2013. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q1 2013, CORE.XP reported that Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland (the European economies most affected by the euro area crisis) had started to show a recovery in property investment activity – albeit from a low base. That recovery seems to have continued in Q2 2013, with those four markets reporting a combined total of €2.5 billion of investment activity, up from less than €1 billion in Q2 2012. Italy saw a particularly large jump, driven by the completion of two large transactions during the quarter. Together these four countries accounted for 8.5% of total European commercial real estate investment activity in Q2 2013 (having hit a low of 3.5% last year). Notably this is in line with their average share of the European market over the last decade, which is also 8.5%. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 There has been a shift in sentiment in the commercial real estate investment market over the last two months, with investors more optimistic now than at the start of the year. This is translating into greater interest in southern European markets and more secondary property that has struggled to attract buyer interest in the past few years. &#13;

 &amp;ldquo;This growth in commercial property investment activity comes at a time when other asset classes have been experiencing increased volatility due to concerns over the future of quantitative easing (QE) and further issues surrounding the euro. The FTSE All Share index fell by 11% from the middle of May to the end of June and the yield on 10-year German government bonds jumped from a low of 1.16% at the start of May to 1.82% near the end of June.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

 “No doubt that growth of investment activity in Europe is a positive sign for Russian commercial real estate market. The latter is on its peak 3rd year in a row. What is even more inspiring is that revival of investors&amp;rsquo; activity occurred in the most suffered European countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy), as well. This fact allows concluding that investor’s optimism about positive resolution of the European economic crisis is growing. What we need now is to see a few confirmations from the real sector statistics. However, the most risk-loving investors in Russian commercial real estate might shift their focus from prime properties in Moscow to other Russian cities. This is especially timely taking into account the lack of supply of such properties in Moscow.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

 H1 2013 was the second most active period for office investment since the start of the 2008 financial crisis. Although the traditionally strong markets of Poland and Russia represent almost 75% of investment activity during H1 2013, deal flow is slowly becoming visible in other parts of the region, including Czech Republic and Romania. Institutional investors who are in the process of restructuring their portfolios and some distress coming to the markets are reasons behind this emerging trend. &#13;

 However, slow economic growth and tenant favoured market conditions are slowing a wider increase of office investment volumes in CEE, with limited activity in the smaller markets of Southeastern Europe. Investors perceive these smaller and less liquid markets clearly as value-add territory especially for office investment. &#13;

 &amp;ldquo;Developers and investors need to contend with lower effective rents when marketing their office properties in today&amp;rsquo;s market situation. Secondary locations will suffer more significantly than buildings that are able to offer contemporary office space in well established and attractive locations. Ultimately a location decision will not be made entirely based on rental levels, as employee requirements are becoming ever more important in locational decisions.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 A slow growth environment in the short-term, a relatively substantial pipeline under construction (U/C), and limited fresh demand for office space is expected to result in a continuation of tenant-favoured market conditions in most of CEE. Unless economic growth shows an upturn the situation is expected to persist through to the end of 2014.  &#13;

 In line with expectations CEE’s occupier demand has remained moderate in the first six months of 2013. With the exception of Warsaw and Belgrade, all other markets saw take-up at or below the averages recorded since the start of the 2008 financial crisis. This does not mean tenants are not taking advantage of the market conditions; however, most of the requirements remain consolidations and renegotiations and therefore have limited (positive) effect on vacancy. &#13;

 “Short-term vacancy points to an imbalanced market situation in most CEE office markets. As is the case in previous cycles, a period of high vacancy may pass relatively quickly in emerging markets; however, low economic growth and limited employment growth prospects do not point at this as yet.” &#13;

 Despite low levels of new demand, office development has remained relatively strong. From the more developed markets, Warsaw stands out in this regard. In total around 450,000 sqm of office space is under construction and expected to be completed through to the end of 2014, with approximately a third of this space already pre-let.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

 Over the quarter, CORE.XP’s EMEA Prime Yield Indices edged lower in the office, retail and industrial sectors by between two and nine basis points and, across the three sectors, around 20% of locations saw yields move lower. These included a number of major office markets such as Brussels, Frankfurt, Dublin and Manchester where yields ended the quarter as much as 25 basis points lower. In the retail sector, changes of this scale were recorded in Madrid, Barcelona, the City of London and Brussels while industrial yields moved lower across most of the UK as well as Paris, Stockholm and Dublin. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Prime rents saw little change across any sector in Q2 2013, and have seen little movement over the past year. At individual city level, rental changes in the second quarter were mostly slight but, despite this, more than twice as many locations recorded rental increases than saw declines. Significant increases occurred in prime office markets including London’s West End, Dublin and Oslo, contrasting with declines in Paris and Milan. Germany featured strongly in the wide pattern of rental increases, with upward moves for Dusseldorf offices, Frankfurt and Hamburg retail, and Munich industrial. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;The downward shifts in yields recorded in the second quarter are consistent with recent improvements in investor sentiment and transactional activity. This is encouraging news for investors and is happening despite the absence of widespread rental growth, which reflects still-weak demand conditions in much of Europe, although we are starting to see some indications of growing incidence of rental uplift.&amp;rdquo;  &#13;

 Office yields across Europe fell slightly during Q2 2013. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index dropped by three basis points in the quarter, and is now 11 bps lower than a year ago. Eleven of the 54 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter, 42 remained unchanged, and one rose. Dubai saw a yield reduction of 50 bps, while a number of other markets fell by 25 bps, including Brussels, Dublin and Manchester. &#13;

 Retail yields also fell in Q2 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Retail Yield Index down by two basis points, leaving it eight basis points lower than a year ago. Yields rose in three of the four Dutch markets (Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague) and fell in ten locations most markedly in Istanbul (down by 100 bps), with notable 25 bp reductions recorded in Madrid, Barcelona and the City of London. Thirty-seven locations remained unchanged. &#13;

 Industrial yields fell in Q2 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Yield Index down by nine basis points in the quarter, and 11 bps lower over the year. Yields fell in nine of the 43 locations studied in Q2 2013 notably London, Paris, Dublin and Stockholm, and rose in two - Barcelona and The Hague. The remaining 32 locations saw no change. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Prime office rents across Europe were effectively unchanged during Q2 2013 and the same is true in year-on-year terms. Over the quarter, eight of the 54 markets in the survey saw increases in prime rents, 44 remained unchanged, and two fell. The largest increase occurred in Dusseldorf, up by 4.7%, with Dublin, Gothenburg and Rotterdam also up by over 4%. The two declines were in Milan (-4.0%) and Paris (-3.6%). &#13;

 Prime retail rents were up marginally in Q2 2013, leaving the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Retail Rent Index 4.0% higher than its position a year ago. Seven of the 50 markets surveyed registered an increase, 37 remained unchanged, and six fell. &#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The largest increase was in London West End (+9% over the quarter), with significant rises also occurring in Istanbul, Frankfurt and Hamburg. The largest declines were in Athens and Dublin, both down by over 10% in the quarter. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 European industrial rents rose marginally in Q2 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up just 0.5% in the quarter, leaving it slightly lower in year-on-year terms. Few locations saw any rental movement in the quarter: only five rose including Abu Dhabi and Oslo (both up by over 10%) and one – Rome – declined. The remaining 37 locations were static. &#13;

 “Market data indicates 2 interesting trends. From one side, tenants’ demand for new space remains quite conservative, leading to stable or slightly decreasing rental rates. From another side, prices of quality properties are slightly growing, indicating that investors, in their majority, are optimistic. It is absolutely not surprising, that Turkey, Germany and London are among the best performing markets. Optimism in the Russian CRE market remains high with observed record investment volumes. At the same time, investors remain cautious: focus is on the prime properties. Investors are still waiting for good news from the Eurozone.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

Nevertheless, 4 modern shopping malls with total GLA of 64 thousand sqm were delivered in Q2. As a result, total stock of the modern retail space in the shopping malls amounted to 3.9 mln sqm. CORE.XP expects 9 new modern shopping malls to be opened till the end of the year. Their total GLA amounts to about 190 thousand sqm. The largest schemes include GoodZone (56 thousand sqm GLA), Raikin Plaza (35 thousand sqm GLA), and RIO Leninsky (31 thousand sqm GLA, official opening). &#13;

 However, modern retail space penetration remains relatively moderate in Q2 2013: 325 sqm per 1,000 inhabitants, as Moscow population grew by more than 50 thousand people. Penetration rate in Moscow is 20-30% below than in other European capitals and implies good potential for successful absorption of new supply over the next few years. &#13;

For example, in Eastern administrative district this indicator is just 146 sqm / 1,000 inhabitants, in South-Western – 206. There is a clear lack of local shopping malls in many city’s administrative districts. This shortage is especially seen in Eastern, South-Eastern, Northern, and North-Western districts of the city. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Moscow shopping centres are quite decentralized by location: more than half of retail space (51.4%) is located between the Third Ring Road and MKAD, 35.6% - beyond MKAD.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Shortage of quality retail space in Moscow still makes it difficult for newly coming international brands to find good locations to open their flagship stores.  &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In H1 the majority of international chain brands have entered the market through large / popular shopping centres, according to the latest data from CORE.XP. The exception is a French mono brand clothes boutique Herv&amp;eacute; Léger, which opened its first store in one of the most largest Moscow retail street. International chains of cafes and restaurants also preferred street retail format. Italian brand of clothes and shoes Stefanel re-opened its store in SC Evropejskiy.  &#13;

 Leading Russian chain retailers continue active regional expansion. Among White and Brown retailers was the retail chain teXet from Saint Petersburg that opened its first street retail store in Moscow at Ladozhskaya street. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In H1 2013 13 international brands entered Moscow market. 5-7 other newcomers have plans for the expansion till the end of the year. On the other hand, French fashion brand Manoukian announced official closure in Russia. By the end of 2013 Russian retailer of kid’s goods Interpol plans to go online format instead of having shops. &#13;

Prime rent was $ 2,060 / sq m/ pa. Low level of vacancy has been stable for the past 3 years. At the end of H1 2013 the vacancy rate accounted to 2.9%. &#13;

 The most interesting trend in the Moscow retail market was active development of retail parks and fashion outlets. Total leasable space of modern shopping malls to be delivered in 2014-2015 exceeds 1.4 mln sqm. Even if half of the planned retail space is delivered, 2014 may become the record year in terms of completion starting from 2009. &#13;

 13 local shops will be delivered in Moscow in the nearest future and that confirms the European trend, mentioned in the latest European research by CORE.XP &amp;lsquo;How We Shop: Inside the Minds of Europe’s Consumers’ that reveals that most Europeans still prefer to visit local shops and down town shopping centres rather than buy products online or shop at suburb retail venues. &#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In the street retail market there is an increased interest from Russian retailers to the &amp;ldquo;old new&amp;rdquo; format of “pop up” store. This format is very common in Europe and appeared in Russia in 2010. Debenhams opened a design boutique in pop up format in the new outlet centre &amp;laquo;Outlet Village Belaya Dacha&amp;raquo;. Another trend is that international chains of cafes and restaurants also prefer to open in street retail format. Lavazza Espression, new brand on the Moscow retail market, opened its first flagship restaurant on Pokrovka street. &#13;

 “Moscow retail property market continues its growth. However, market develops unevenly in terms of both format and location of the shopping malls. Major part of 2013 new delivery is classic super regional shopping malls. In Q2 70% of retail space was delivered due to the opening of two outlet centres. Developers became more interested in the format of small neighborhood and community shopping centres, which are in deficit on the Moscow market. At the same time, market is still far from saturation: the number of quality sites for newly entering international chains is limited. This fact already became a serious obstacle for few players. This situation is expected to change in 2014, when a record delivery of new quality schemes might occur. New projects will create better conditions for the development of the branded retail.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

 Major trends of the Moscow office market in Q2 2013:  &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Just 6 office buildings (81,000 sq m of office space), including only one Class A office building, were put into operation&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The lowest level of new delivery for the last 8 years, however, the new supply for 2013 is expected to total 860,000 sq m&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Stable demand&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Continuing decentralization: the zone beyond the Third Transport Ring saw the highest volume of both new delivery (67%) and take-up (57%)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;73% of deals were closed in Class B buildings, in Class A &amp;ndash; only 27%&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The majority of deals were signed by Russian companies, 67% of the total&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The most popular office size was blocks up to 1,000 sq m, 70% of the total number of deals&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Stable level of overall vacancy rate (11.7%)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Stable rents&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 The total Moscow office market take-up was 556,000 sq. m from the beginning of the year. 335,000 sq m out of which refers to the deals closed in Q2 2013. This number is 34% higher than the volume of deals closed in Q1 2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q2 the volume of Class A take-up increased by 73% compared to Q1 figure and reached 90,000 sq m.  &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q2 Class B take –up was in majority and totaled to 244,000 sq m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 It is quite interesting that continuing the trend of 2012, the majority of the deals in 2013, were signed in office blocks of less than 1,000 sq m (72% of the total number of done deals in H1 2013). Though it is quite important to emphasize some larger size of deals of over 2,000 sq m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 One of the major deals in Q2 was the signing of pre-lease agreement for 10,800 sq m in Bolshevik Factory by Publicis Groupe. First of all this deal was a pre-lease deal. The preliminary lease agreements were common in pre-crises years and became rare in the last 4 years.  &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Like in Q1 2013, Russian companies made up a substantial part of the total take-up (67%). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 According to the latest report demand from international companies is expected to rise in near-term outlook.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q2 high activity was registered from banking and finance sectors, from the energy industry, auto and logistics companies. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 New delivery. On the contrary to the record Q1 2013, new office space delivery in Q2 was the minimal in the past 5 years. In Q2 just 6 business centres totaling 81,497 sq m of office space were put into operation. Delays in the delivery of several properties meant supply was limited in Q2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;border: 0px none; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px; padding: 5px 0px 10px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 However, the total delivery for H1 2013 was 341,000 sq m (36% more than in H1 2012). So, in H1 2013 around 40% of the announced pipeline for 2013 was put into operation, that’s why such low numbers will not reflect on a volume of new delivery by the end of the year. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q2 2013 the overall vacancy rate decreased from 11% to 10.75%. This modest change confirms the balance between demand and supply in the market. The balance will remain till the year-end with possible increase in the Class A segment and decrease in the Class B segment. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Vacancy rate in Class A segment has not changed much relative to the previous quarter - 15,6%. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The Class B segment demonstrated a decrease in vacancy in comparison to Q1 2013 - 10,8%. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 During Q2 2013 rental rates were stable, similar to the whole 2012: $1,100 – $1,200 for Prime Class A, $650 – $750 for Class А, $400 – $450 for Class В (per sq. m per year net of OpEx and VAT). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Moscow office market will remain stable till the end of the year. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The vacancy level is expected to decrease in the Class B segment (8-9%) and in class A vacancy, it’s expected to remain stable at 15%. The total volume of take-up will be at a level of 500,000 – 600,000 sq m, the rents will remain unchanged till the year-end &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Estimated new delivery by the end of the year is expected around 860,000 sq. m.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

 &amp;ldquo;The situation in office market in Moscow as a whole could be described as stable. We do not expect major changes until the end of the year. However the increased volumes of new office delivery and a number of closed deals in comparison to the results of H1 and H2 2012, let us say that the sentiments in the market are more positive.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow , 24 September 2013 – The first half of 2013 saw significant North American investment in European retail with North American investors being the strongest net buyers of property in this sector, according to the latest CORE.XP Research.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;A total of &amp;euro;15 billion was transacted in retail real estate in H1 2013, which is an increase of 17% on the same period in 2012. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;North American investors were the most active cross-regional buyers of European retail in H1 2013 overall - with €1.6 billion net. They focused their acquisitions on Russia and the UK, although they also made acquisitions in other major Western European markets such as Germany and France. In the last 18 months, American investors have set record-breaking (in terms of lot size) deals in Europe. H1 2013 was no exception, with the Morgan Stanley&amp;rsquo;s purchase of Moscow’s Metropolis Centre being the largest retail deal in Europe - and twice the size of the second-largest retail transaction.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

   &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;North American investors stayed firmly focused on the shopping centre segment, which matches their preference for large deal size and their familiarity with the shopping centre sector. By value, shopping centres accounted for 75% of their retail acquisitions in H1 2013. This is very much in contrast to Asian and Middle Eastern capital, which, while acting across a wide range of geographies, has shown a clear preference for high street retail.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;North American capital’s appetite for European retail spans beyond the direct investment market, US fund manager is close to completing a corporate takeover of one of Europe’s largest shopping centre developers - highlighting the willingness to commit large amounts of capital to the European market either – directly or indirectly.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

   &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;In terms of the overall European retail investment market – the latest results are healthy, with €15 billion transacted in H1 2013, a 17% increase on the same period in 2012. In keeping with the historic trend, the UK and Germany were by far the two largest markets, followed by CEE, which driven by demand for Russian retail in particular, pushed the Nordic region into fourth place and France into fifth. Outside the above markets, there remains relatively little activity, especially in Southern Europe or the Netherlands. Despite attractive pricing in these markets, investor risk aversion continues. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;However, this might change soon. Broader economic recovery in Europe is starting to manifest in improved retail sales and consumer confidence, especially across the main Western economies such as the UK, Germany and France.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size: 15px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;“Looking forward, and considering the more positive economic trends, the pricing for prime retail is expected to remain fairly stable, with possible further yield tightening in some markets. The improved economic outlook, combined with tight development pipeline, should also translate into stronger rental growth prospects, certainly at the core end of the market. The fact that the euro zone is officially out of recession is leading more investors to pursue opportunities in the secondary sector.” &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

During the last 3 years they generated about 23% of the total investment volumes, which is more than all other countries did altogether. Population incomes in Moscow are steadily approaching European levels, being supported by high oil prices. In this regard, we can just repeat once more that investors from other countries significantly overweight their risks and business doing complications in Russia.”&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Europe is the most exposed global region to cross-border property; since 2007 inflows from outside Europe have accounted for 18% of all investment activity. The proportion of cross-border investment coming from outside Europe has increased markedly in recent years (reaching 22.4% in 2012-H1 2013), with capital from Asian investors (&amp;euro;7.8 billion) and (more recently) from North America (€18.9 billion) entering the European market in increasing amounts. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Cross-regional capital (that which comes into the European market from other parts of the world) and intra-regional capital (cross-border investment, but from inside Europe) are roughly equal in terms of total value of transactions executed, each making up just over 20% of total buying activity in Europe recently. However, these two different types of cross-border investor tend to invest in very different types of property and, to an extent, in different locations too. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Cross-regional investment has an importance to the market beyond its volume. The transactions of international investors have tended to concentrate in large lot size, high-profile properties in a specific range of markets. For a certain class of assets, therefore, international capital sets the tone both in terms of market turnover and pricing trends. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 This is most apparent in the size of deals executed by the different types of investor. In H1 2013, domestic investors in Europe were highly concentrated in smaller transactions, with an average transaction size of €21 million. Cross-border investors from other parts of Europe targeted larger lot-sizes, averaging €42 million per transaction. However, those from outside Europe entirely invested in still larger lot sizes, with an average deal size of €94 million. Of the 35 UK transactions in H1 2013 with a lot size of &amp;pound;100 million or more, 22 were bought, either in whole or in part, by an investor from outside Europe.  &#13;

London, Paris and the main German cities take a very high proportion of the total due to the transparency, overall liquidity and a steady flow of the right type of investment opportunities available. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Cross-regional investors from different continents also appear to have different characteristics in terms of the countries they invest in and the type of properties they buy. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investment from North America into Europe has tended to come in the form of collective investment vehicles. These funds often invest on behalf of institutions, but are more likely to use leverage and appear to be more focused on returns than diversification. They have typically invested in a wider range of locations than other cross-regional investors and have been more likely to look at value-add and opportunistic acquisitions. Investors from North America have shown a strong bias towards Germany compared to other cross-regional investors. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Buyers from the Middle East are more diverse in nature, with a variety of institutional (mostly sovereign wealth funds) and private capital making up the total. A disproportionate amount of Middle Eastern capital is invested in alternative sectors (particularly hotels). The majority of Middle Eastern investment into Europe has been into the UK, but a significant amount has also been targeted at France and Germany. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investment from Asia has tended to be direct investment by institutions – sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance companies. Investment has been concentrated in a relatively small number of locations, with a strong preference for the UK, and is also highly concentrated in the office sector. Notably, investors from Asia have the largest average lot size for their transactions. &#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Europe will be a natural home for much of the real estate allocation from global capital flows as long as its markets retain the characteristics of transparency and liquidity, while also offering diversification benefits against assets that are denominated in, or pegged to, the dollar. These factors have helped attract the institutional style capital that typically makes up the flows out of Asia. There is no reason to expect these fundamentals to change in the foreseeable future; therefore, we can expect capital from outside Europe to continue influencing the European market over several more years. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Looking ahead, Asian investment in particular is expected to grow as China, Japan and Taiwan, and then countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and ultimately India, become sources of cross-regional capital flows. Sovereign wealth funds from countries where natural resources are only now starting to be exploited, such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, are also likely to be of future significance with a number of African countries also showing some potential.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

 “Around 25% of the investment into Russian commercial real estate comes from North America. Asian investors&amp;rsquo; contribution is rather small. Strict requirements to the country investment climate and market transparency are the key objectives for investments of the sovereign and pension funds and insurance companies. Development of comfortable investment climate and legislation for this, the most conservative part of the investors’ community, is the key potential for further growth of the investments into Russian commercial real estate market.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

 While activity by non-European buyers has increased in H1 2013, commercial real estate investment remains concentrated in a small number of European cities. The mature markets of London and Paris continue to lead in terms of their share of the European market and are ranked first and second respectively, while Moscow is now in third position. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 A high level of interest from both international and domestic real estate investors has led to increased activity in several German cities, with Dusseldorf (+210%), Frankfurt (+72%), Hamburg (+52%) and Berlin (+24%) all experiencing significant growth compared to the same period in 2012. Munich (+2%) continues to be the preferred investment destination in Germany and one of the most preferred in Europe overall. &#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 German investors have been highly focused on their home market in recent years and this focus intensified in H1 2013 with 76% of acquisitions by German investors in Europe being in their domestic markets (compared to 53% in 2007-2009). The number of foreign buyers targeting the German market has also increased, with international investors from 21 different countries making acquisitions in Germany so far in 2013. Frankfurt, in particular, has seen a substantial proportion of investment from outside of Europe (39% of the total). &#13;

 &amp;ldquo;Following high investment volumes by North American and Korean investors in German real estate, we expect international interest to continue with Asian sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors actively looking for new opportunities beyond their national borders, with a particular interest from Chinese insurance funds. German real estate is an attractive proposition for investors as they look for international markets that can combine attractive yield levels with stability and transparency to satisfy risk requirements for their asset allocations.&amp;rdquo;  &#13;

 London and Moscow stand out as having attracted the highest proportion of cross-regional investment, with over 60% of transactions in both cities completed by non-European buyers. This increase in investment from outside Europe is a major driver of the market as non-European buyers accounted for 28% of transactions in H1 2013 up from 22%% in H1 2012. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 As one of the largest cities in Europe by population, Moscow’s rise as a real estate investment destination is long overdue; with a 63% increase in activity in H1 2012 driving the city to third position on the rankings. Population on its own is clearly not a driver of investment activity, but it does serve as a proxy for economic importance of a city. High influx of international, predominantly North American capital, was the main reason behind Moscow’s rise in the H1 2013 investment ranking.  &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The first six months of 2013 saw a slight fall in activity in Paris, although the city is still a highly attractive investment destination, ranking second in the overall list. While investment in Paris from outside the region has remained broadly consistent, cross-border investment from within Europe was much lower than normal at 17% of total investment in H1 compared to a long term average of 30%, although this was countered by a high proportion of investment from local French investors. &#13;

 “Despite all its problems, Moscow is strengthening its positions in Top-3 of the most attractive European cities for investments in the commercial real estate. This process is supported by increased activity of experienced investors, who know how to work in Russia.

The history of the modern warehouse market in the Moscow region started in 2006, when larger part of newly delivered properties were located close to MKAD, or less than in 15 km from the city. Today, about 90% of the modern warehouse complexes and logistics parks are located within the A107 highway. The majority of new warehouse projects are located in close vicinity to its crossings with major highways of the Moscow region. These locations are expected to be the &amp;ldquo;major construction sites&amp;rdquo; in the next 2-3 years, according to the latest research by CORE.XP.&#13;

Developers were focused, first of all, on the most popular areas, such as south and south-east.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nowadays, active development is seen in the northern part of the Moscow region. This area witnesses a considerable demand for warehouse space due to the construction of the new speed highway M11 (Moscow – St. Petersburg). Delivery of new modern highways with opportunity of high-speed traffic will create foundation to locate warehouse buildings and logistics parks on sites, where it seemed to be unacceptable just recently. In its report CORE.XP compares Moscow with Paris, where in &amp;Icirc;le-de-France market area distance from warehouse site to city borders may amount to 70-100 km.&#13;

Today, the Moscow region is the largest consumer of retail goods. That is why for retailers and also for logistics companies and distributors, as for main users of warehouse complexes (70% of total existing stock is used by companies from these sectors), transport accessibility to the city is really important. According to the Moscow region investment program “Development of transport and logistics system of Moscow region in 2011-2015” key logistic and warehouse projects will be located along CRR, consisting of one smaller ring and bigger half-ring, which is expected to make possible cargo logistics operations across the region without usage of currently overloaded routes inside A107 highway and MKAD. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Besides the construction of CRR, the Russian government approved reconstruction plan of the major highways. Currently Novorizhskoye highway is being reconstructed from MKAD to A108 highway, the reconstruction is completed on Kievskoye highway (from MKAD to A107 highway) and on Minskoye highway (within A107 ring road). By 2018 the rest of Minskoye highway will be reconstructed (from A107 highway and up to the Moscow region’s borders).&#13;

Excellent transport infrastructure and existing low competition will be the key success factors to the new projects there.&#13;

“In 3 years West and South-West of the Moscow region might become one of the most popular areas for new warehouse complexes development. If all announced transport infrastructure projects will be realized in time, expected driving time will be decreased twice and more. As a result, just in a few years we might see development of new I&amp;amp;amp;L projects at more than 50-60 km distance from the city.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 23 October 2013 &amp;ndash; The European commercial real estate investment market had its strongest third quarter since 2007 with &amp;euro;35.5 billion in transactions - up 21% on Q3 2012, according to the latest data from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Commercial real estate investment in the core Western European markets – UK, Germany and France – was particularly strong in Q3 2013. Investment in UK commercial property was at the highest level since Q3 2007 with €14.1 billion of transactions completed in Q3 2013 - a 19% increase over Q3 2012. Germany, with €6.2 billion in Q3 2013, showed a 21% increase over Q3 2012. France also had its highest Q3 investment activity since 2007 with €4.6 billion - a 39% increase on Q3 2012. These markets also posted sequential gains compared with Q2 2013, with investment activity for all of Europe improving 7% compared with the prior quarter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The markets that were most affected by the eurozone crisis - Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain - recovered strongly in H1 2013 and this trend continued in the third quarter. In Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Portugal) commercial real estate investment totalled €2.2 billion in Q3 2013, up by 145% on Q3 2012. Investment activity in Ireland increased 354% over the same period. This performance shows that opportunistic investors are returning to Europe and targeting recovering markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) commercial real estate investment totalled €2.3 billion in Q3 2013, up 33% on Q3 2012. Activity in the CEE was led by the core markets of Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Despite the fact that commercial real estate investment in Russia in Q3 2013  is 17% lower than in 2012, YTD investments indicated impressive 46% increase. Investment volumes exceeded $1 billion mark 6th quarter in a row. Average quarterly investment volumes reached really high $1.6 bln.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Investors showed their readiness to accept higher risks. The acquisition of large non-stabilized assets is seen in the market. There is also increasing interest to the regional properties, and growing number of &amp;ldquo;big tickets&amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Both the core and opportunistic sectors of the European commercial real estate market are in favour with investors. In Germany, France and the UK, there are still a large number of risk-averse investors focused on core markets and prime assets. However, opportunistic investors are growing in number (and spending power) and this is driving increased investment in those countries that were hardest hit by the euro crisis. In contrast, markets in countries that do not fit either of these categories, such as The Nordics and to some extent Benelux, are not experiencing the same growth in activity as those at either end of the risk spectrum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Head of EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;“Europe showed strong investment levels in Q3 2013, led by core Western European markets and the continued recovery of Southern Europe. With nearly €100 billion of transactions already in the first three quarters, 2013 should post solid gains in investment activity over 2012.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;MsoNormal&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;“A year ago we predicted that first signs of economic recovery in Eurozone in Q2 –Q3 2013 would boost investment activity. And now we see the growth of investment interest not only to ever-popular UK, Germany, France, but also to the so-called “peripheral countries”. In the last case the growth is measured in times. In the last 1.5 years Russia enjoyed around $10 bln. of investment in commercial real estate. These figures can grow even further when Russian government will indicate a “recipe” to restore high GDP growth rates, which we had observed just recently.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 25 October 2013 &amp;ndash; Falling yields across all property sectors and a moderate increase in rental values provides further evidence of growing momentum in European commercial property markets. The findings from CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s Q3 2013 survey of prime rents and yields backs up the picture of recovering investment markets across the region, which have benefitted from increased capital targeting the sector and improved investor sentiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over Q3 2013, CORE.XP’s EMEA Prime Yield Indices edged lower in the office, retail and industrial sectors by between three and five basis points. Of the three sectors, the office market showed the most widespread movements, with yields moving lower in nearly a quarter of the locations surveyed including Amsterdam, Dublin and all the major UK regional cities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Within this group, Belfast and Edinburgh recorded yield reductions of 50 basis points. Dublin office yields moved lower for the fourth consecutive quarter, and are now 100 basis points below their level of a year ago. Significantly Madrid and Lisbon office yields also moved 25 bps lower this quarter. The retail sector also saw some significant changes, most notably, a shift in the prime central London retail yield to below 3%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rental improvement was most evident in the prime retail market, where nearly a quarter of the locations surveyed saw an increase, twice as many as declined. The increases encompassed some of the most prestigious retail locations in Europe, with rental increases recorded in Paris, London and Milan, as well as further afield in Istanbul and Dubai.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rental momentum is less evident in the office market, where almost as many locations fell as rose. Downward pressure continued in parts of southern Europe including Rome and Madrid. Most of the increases occurred in smaller markets, although Munich edged up and prime rents in the West End of London hit &amp;pound;100 per sq ft. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Director, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, said: &amp;amp;quot;The yield movements recorded in the third quarter sustain the trend towards gradual improvement in pricing that has been in train since the second half of last year. On average, prime yields have fallen by around 15 basis points across all sectors over this period, and there are indications of investment appetite spreading to secondary assets in some markets. Rental growth remains patchy, and is most evident in the prime retail sector, but we expect it to become more widespread as European economies continue to recover.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;YIELDS &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Office yields across EMEA fell during Q3 2013. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index fell by three basis points in the quarter, and is now 16 bps lower than a year ago. Thirteen of the 55 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter and 42 remained unchanged. The most significant yield reductions were in the UK where both Edinburgh and Belfast dropped by 50bps. A number of other markets saw 25 bps movements including Dublin and Madrid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Retail yields also moved lower in Q3 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Retail Yield Index down by four basis points, leaving it 15 basis points lower than a year ago. Yields fell in eleven locations, notably London’s West End where the prime yield level is now below 3%, and Lisbon and St Petersburg where yields fell by 50bps. Yields rose in two locations, Birmingham and Edinburgh. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Industrial yields fell in Q3 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Yield Index down by five basis points in the quarter, and 14 bps over the year. Yields fell in six locations including 50 basis point movements in Manchester, St Petersburg and Dublin, with London also moving lower. The two increases were recorded in Barcelona and The Hague. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RENTS &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prime office rents across Europe were unchanged during Q3 2013 and the same is true in year-on-year terms. Over the quarter, five of the 55 markets in the survey saw increases in prime rents, 46 remained unchanged, and four fell. The largest increase was in Johannesburg (up 6%). Munich also rose, as did London’s West End where prime rents hit £100 per sq ft. The largest fall was in Prague (-4.8%), the other reductions being in Madrid, Rome and Geneva. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Prime retail rents were up 2.8% in Q3 2013, leaving the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Retail Rent Index nearly 7% higher than a year ago. Twelve of the 51 markets surveyed registered an increase, 33 remained unchanged, and six fell. Several markets saw double-digit increases most notably Paris, Milan and Rome. London’s West End also saw rents improve (up 4.2%). The six fallers comprised the Dutch markets along with Lille and Athens. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Industrial rents rose marginally in Q3 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up by 0.6% in the quarter, and the same in year-on-year terms. Four of the 47 sample locations rose and the remainder stayed unchanged. The largest increase was in Oslo which saw growth of 9% over the quarter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;amp;quot;Around 20% of the monitored markets indicated decrease in prime yields due to growth in prices. The latter occurs in line with increasing demand, which is observed even in still risky for investments &amp;amp;quot;peripheral&amp;amp;quot; South-European countries. Investors are tired of depression and are investing in expectations of the quick end of economic recession. Prime yields in Russia are still stable. Increased investors’ readiness to risk is indicated via grown interest to non-stabilized and regional assets, which were acquired in a number for transactions, totaling more than $1 bln.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moscow, 5 November - CORE.XP, the exclusive leasing and marketing agent for the Premier Shopping Centre in Ryazan in Russia, announces the grand opening of the first family amusement park in town &amp;ndash; Funky Town, which leased 2,500 sq m there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The park is located on the 3 floor of Premier Shopping Centre, the first modern Class A shopping centre in Ryazan, that stands out among its competitors. There are 99 game-machines from industry leaders from the USA, Japan, the UK  and other European countries, as well as  there are 7 rides from Italy that are offered for children and their parents. The 8th ride will be opened in November for the most little ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 7 amusement parks under Funky Town brand that are currently functioning in Kazakhstan and in Russia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anastasia Sharkova, Associate Director, Retail Department, CORE.XP Russia, commented: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Premier has proved itself as a high class shopping centre for the whole family and the grand opening of Funky Town is definitely a symbolic moment for Ryazan. The unique concept of the park that has entertainment for children of different ages focuses on education. Funky town arranges celebration of different holidays, events, birthdays every day. And the fact that this amusement park offers family entertainment, makes Premier shopping centre even more popular&amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; London - Moscow, 31 October 2013 &amp;ndash; Energy demand is shifting from OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to non-OECD countries. Average office rental growth in emerging energy dependent cities is up 10.6% for the year, compared to established business centres at 2.9%, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Technological advances, shifting patterns in demand for energy, and limited supply in some markets has seen oil prices bouncing back to pre-recession levels. OECD energy consumption fell by 1.2% y-o-y between 2011 to 2012, yet grew 4.2% across non-OECD countries over the same period. 90% of this demand is coming from emerging economies, namely China and India. This shift is impacting on the operational decisions of firms in the energy industry, with office space being sought in new markets and consolidated in established business centres. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, Caracus, an energy dependent city in Venezuela, has seen pick up of 96.5% y-o-y in office rents. Likewise the business centre Jakarta, which sits in the emerging market of Indonesia, has seen a 49% increase. As these cities develop further as energy sector hubs, demand for real estate is set to increase, accelerating rental growth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luanda, the energy dependent capital of Angola, has also seen a pick-up in office rents with a 20.0% increase y-o-y to the second quarter of 2013. Angola is the second biggest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, with energy sector occupiers accounting for 63% of total office take-up in 2012. Significantly, with very low supply and high demand, its prime rent of $200.67 per sq ft pa, is higher than London at $149.1 per sq ft pa, which puts it second only to Hong Kong ($206.6 per sq ft pa), of the 34 cities surveyed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the primary base for oil and gas companies&amp;rsquo; HQ, Moscow generates significant tax revenues. According to the World Bank, oil and gas provide half of the revenues of the central government’s budget and two thirds of Russia’s exports. The sustained high price of oil is resulting in a positive outlook for the sector. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oil and gas sector’s share in the total take-up is stable and accounts to approx. 10% every year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Armstrong, Director, Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP, said: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Energy markets are evolving. Supply is coming from an increasingly diverse range of locations. This diversification is impacting companies’ operational decisions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Office rental growth is trending upwards in emerging energy dependent markets, with growth lower in more mature markets. Broadly, prime office rents remain higher in established office markets over emerging markets. However, the acceleration of energy production in non-OECD countries has led to rapid increases in demand for high quality office space. Cities like Luanda, and Caracas are struggling to meet this demand which is keeping rental values high and vacancy rates low.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“During Q1-Q3 2013 oil and gas companies were traditionally active on the real estate market. Companies tend to choose offices in southern, south-west locations and in the CBD. Rental rates have been stable for the last couple of years. Some of the big companies often buy premises not only lease them or even invest in built-to-suit. For example, Lukoil finished construction of the new building located close to the company’s HQ (Sretensky blvd., 11)”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Total European retail investment grew to &amp;euro;8.3 billion in Q3 2013 - an 11.5% increase on the previous quarter and the highest quarterly total to date this year. Investment activity is broadening, both geographically and in terms of asset quality, with the Southern European markets of Italy (+128%) and Spain (+472%) seeing significant increases on the previous quarter. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 While Southern Europe has seen more investors bidding on opportunities this year, Q3 2013 is the first quarter to turn this uplift into investor activity. Investment in the region is spread across the different segments and markets, with both local and international players active. Blackstone&amp;rsquo;s circa &amp;euro;130 million purchase of Franciacorta Outlet Village in Brescia, Italy is just one of the larger deals to complete this quarter. Demand for high street retail in Southern Europe is also strong, with Italy one of the few markets to see prime rental growth in Q3 2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Italy has seen a significant improvement in investor sentiment following the ECB&amp;rsquo;s defence of the eurozone, the on-going reforms&amp;rsquo; plan of the new Italian Government, and market re-pricing in course. The growth in retail investment is expected to continue in Q4 2013 with MSREF&amp;rsquo;s 60% stake in an Italian retail portfolio. This includes 15 shopping malls (anchored by Auchan) and is by far the largest transaction to complete in Italy this year at &amp;euro;635 million. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Paolo Bellacosa, Head of Capital Markets, CORE.XP Italy, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;The conditions to make Italy more appealing to investors are currently in place and appetite for retail in particular is dominating commercial real estate volumes, with foreign investors now tempted by the attractive risk-return opportunities. The largest private equity groups are the most active players, but we are also seeing some core, GDP-based investors looking at Iong-term retail investments.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Spain, there were several significant acquisitions of core retail assets by global investors in Q3 2013. These include the purchase of Parque Principado shopping centre in Oviedo by Intu Capital/CPPIB for &amp;euro;161 million, while Orion Capital acquired whole ownership of Puerto Venecia shopping centre in Zaragoza following the purchase of a further 50% stake for &amp;euro;144.5 million. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Adolfo Ramirez-Escudero, Managing Director, Capital Markets, CORE.XP Spain, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;amp;quot;The Spanish market has completely changed in the space of a year. A total of &amp;euro;1.5 billion has been transacted in commercial real estate in the last four months - more than half of the total volume last year. We have expected retail investors to move further along the risk spectrum for some time, but this is the first quarter to provide substantial evidence of this. The foreign money is returning to Iberia and we will see more retail deals of size before the year end.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Western Europe, retail investment activity is notably down on the three-year average in most markets, including the UK, Germany, Benelux and the Nordics, but in-line with recent quarters. France is the only exception due to a couple of large transactions, including the &amp;euro;250 million sale-and-leaseback of the Metro cash-and-carry portfolio. Supply constraints, combined with high prices, are starting to encourage investment into second-tier markets and towards more value-add, secondary product. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Growing demand for retail property in South European countries is a good evidence of increase of investors&amp;rsquo; readiness to &amp;ldquo;buy risk&amp;rdquo;. It is improving fundamentals of Eurozone economy that drives growing attention to the so called 2nd tier markets and value add assets. The latter will show the best growth of asset prices in a case of more aggressive economic recovery in Europe. In Russia this trend is seen, first of all, in development, while investors are still concentrated on the prime properties.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow,11 November 2013 &amp;ndash; The recovering European economy and a rise in net migration into Germany will lead to acceleration in retail sales growth attracting more domestic and international retailers to the country, according to the latest research by global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The research, based on market size, tourist spending and growth potential, highlights the potential hotspots of retail consumer demand with 14 German regions featured in CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s top 60 ranking. The recent upsurge of migration into Germany will have a positive impact on retail sales growth at the national level and, in particular, on some of the large German cities where good employment prospects make them natural magnets for new migrants. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;There are five German markets in the top 25 with Munich (3); Hamburg (13); and Mannheim (23), Frankfurt (24), and Berlin (25). Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, Freiburg, Cologne and Osnabr&amp;uuml;k also appear in the top 50. These findings are supported by CORE.XP’s research How Active are Retailers in EMEA, which found that more major retailers are planning to expand in Germany than in any other European country (53% compared with 23% in the UK).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Neil Blake, Head of UK and EMEA Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Population is a key determinant of spending power in a demographically constrained but economically successful country like Germany. Higher population will mean more spending, pushing up the space needs of domestic retailers and making Germany a more attractive destination for international retailers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The recent increase in net migration in Germany has already led to a leveling off of the population. Moreover, most of the migrants are economically active people who are successful in finding jobs in Germany. Should net migration stabilise at around 250,000 per annum, German population will increase at a higher rate than indicated by official projections and a number of regions, in particular, will perform far better than the German average. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“While growth is important, initial market size also matters because slower growth in a big market may be more attractive to retailers than higher growth in a small market. Markets such as Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt offer growth, critical mass and space for retailer expansion and for commercial real estate investment.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;With higher migration, Munich will see a population growth increase by 106bps to 3.2%, relative to the official projections. Hamburg and Berlin see even bigger increases of 124 and 122 bps respectively to 2.8% and 1.8% by 2015.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;With seven regions listed in the same top 60, Turkey has by far the most retail sales growth potential in Europe with an average forecasted sales growth of 4.8% per annum. Istanbul is also to benefit from a cumulative 15% growth from 2013 to 2015. Turkey has levels of pending per head that are well below those found in Western Europe. These levels cause the potential for high sales growth when combined with the prospects of Turkey’s high economic growth.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The size of Inner London pushes the market to second in the ranking with a forecasted growth of just over half (7.8%) that of Istanbul. At present, the UK economy appears to have the fastest growing economy in Western Europe.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Sweden and Norway are forecast to see good retail sales growth with 2.6% and 2.3% respectively. Regions from these countries feature high in the list of results with Stockholm ranking fourth and Oslo sixth. Oslo is forecasted to have the highest increase of retail sales in the Nordics with an estimated rise of 9.3% in sales from 2013-2015. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 12 November 2013 Major oil companies (ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Total and Chevron) now own just a third of Europe&amp;rsquo;s petrol filling stations, according to the latest research from global real estate advisor CORE.XP. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Europe’s largest oil companies are now placing greater emphasis on upstream activities, namely exploration and production, shifting focus from downstream retail activity, by exiting from less profitable real estate sites. This is illustrated by Shell announcing the potential divestment of its Italian service station portfolio and Esso’s sale of 45 sites in the UK to Euro Garages in a consolidated portfolio deal this year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Such divestment by major oil companies is creating opportunities for independent petrol retailers, who now own exactly 20%, of all petrol filling stations across Europe, compared to 16% in 2007. Across the same period major oil companies’ market share decreased 11%, from 43% in 2007 to 32% today.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This trend is most pronounced in less mature European markets, with independent petrol retailers having the strongest foothold in Bulgaria, where they account for almost two thirds of filling stations at 64%. In Czech Republic the figure is 56%, and over a third of petrol filling stations have been acquired by independents in Hungary, Belgium, Poland and Romania. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In contrast, major oil companies are opting to retain a stronger presence in Europe’s most mature petroleum markets including Denmark and France where just 6% and 13% of filling stations are owned by independents. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The shift of petrol filling station ownership from major oil companies to independent retailers is likely to result in an increase in retail provision at many of these sites. One provider, Polish-based Grupa Lotos has recently announced plans to develop its non-fuel business due to declining fuel margins. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As larger independent retailers increase investment to expand their convenience retailing and provide better quality stations, further growth of the independent network is expected. This will keep a check on prices and provide genuine pricing competition. However, as the independent retailers grow they are expected to assume as much market dominance as the oil companies. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Simon Galway, Executive Director, Global Corporate Services, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The macro-economic environment continues to present challenges for corporates. This is why real estate portfolios are being examined, across all sectors, to seek ways to control costs. In the petroleum sector, we envisage that major oil companies will continue to optimise downstream real estate portfolios as they separate retail and production activities, with independent petrol retailers poised to capitalise.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Many European markets, most notably Germany, Denmark and the UK, development of alternative fuel sources will lead to the need for new distribution networks, and utilising existing filling stations. For this reason, we expect major oil companies to retain some visibility across these markets, so they are in a position to benefit from these developments.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

At a time when there is an unprecedented level of consumer access to the internet across Europe, CORE.XP has completed the most comprehensive and most far-reaching study of its kind, canvassing the opinions of more than 10,000 shoppers across Europe to discover how and where they shop.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report - &amp;lsquo;How We Shop: Inside the Minds of Europe&amp;rsquo;s Consumers’ - reveals that while online retailing continues to grow in appeal, consumers do not intend to radically change their shopping habits in the coming years and the overwhelming majority are yet to fully embrace new technology and digital tools such as QR codes. Two thirds of consumers said that price of goods, cleanliness, security and convenient access were the most important factors when choosing where to shop. Entertainment and leisure were also deemed important by a third of those surveyed and by more than half of the younger age group.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite competition from online and out-of-town shopping, town centres and the high street continue to be the preferred option for European consumers. As a result, the pace of change of retail fundamentals is relatively slow with the physical store continuing to play a key role in the new, multichannel world.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Highlights from the report include:&#13;

&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;bull;	Local shops and town centres are visited most frequently for clothing shopping – at least once a month on average. For out-of-town shopping centres the average visit frequency is every six weeks. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	78% of Europeans choose to shop for fashion goods in town centres, rising to approximately 90% among those living in Western Europe.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	Two-thirds or more of consumers indicated that price of goods, cleanliness, security, good/free parking and convenient access were the most important factors when choosing where to shop. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	The range of retailers and, in particular, the size of their stores (and consequent ability to carry a full range of goods) were high up the list of consumers’ priorities.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	54% of consumers use a car when visiting town centres and 76% do so for out-of-town centres; 30% of journeys to local shops are also taken by car, suggesting that parking provision is important for customer satisfaction and footfall whether in or out-of town.&#13;

When buying online, 64% of consumers prefer home delivery, but 85% said it was important to have access to a physical store to view/touch clothes before buying online. &#13;

&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	Digital tools have yet to fully take hold. For example, fewer than one third of consumers in Europe have ever compared prices on their mobiles in-store or used QR codes to access websites; however, usage will increase in the future given the higher take-up today among 16 to 34 year olds.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The ‘essentials’ of a successful retail destination – value, convenience, cleanliness and security –remain uppermost in shoppers’ minds. While many retailers are adapting to technological advances, consumers are telling us that they do not intend to radically change their shopping habits in the immediate future. Consumers are far less interested in mobile technology and QR codes than the retail industry itself, so perhaps investment is better spent elsewhere.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Convenience is still the consumer’s watchword; people like to shop locally and they want their shopping destinations to be easily accessible by car and free to park in. Out-of-town centres usually offer free parking, but town centre shopping facilities normally charge putting themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Our advice to town centre managers, shopping centres and retail investors is listen to what consumers want, concentrate on getting the basics right, and this will ultimately give you the best chance of success.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

Street retail in Russia is virtually absent (excepting Moscow and Saint-Petersburg there is no formed High Street). The prevalence of the classic SC (shopping centres) determines the choice of consumer – that’s a place where Russians typically do major purchases.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Another important factor for choosing where to shop is location: most shopping centers in Russia are located outside of city centres, close to the &amp;amp;quot;bedroom community&amp;amp;quot;. Large shopping centres that are located in the city centre are rather isolated examples than a rule (Evropeyskiy in Moscow, Greenvich in Yekaterinburg, Koltso in Kazan).&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
With regard to purchases made via Internet, their volume of online retail is growing in Russia, however it is still lower than in Europe. More and more retailers develop online format (not just books, appliances, tickets, but also clothing and food). However, not all consumers are willing to make purchases over the Internet - many of them only look for and select products online, yet buy them in stores.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In the context of the results of this study both Moscow developers and retailers should focus on the fact that customers welcome the opportunity to buy quality clothes in local shopping centers located in residential areas. Constant traffic jams and increasing travel time to get to the major shopping centres, will have an increasingly strong impact on consumer preferences, rising their interest in district format shopping centers and street retail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

By the way, the Moscow Government is already planning the development of street-retail in residential areas.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

Strong trading in Russia (€2.5 billion) has resulted in total property investment volumes at around two thirds of the dealings seen during 2012 overall. While Poland (around €750 million) is less active compared to previous quarters, a strong asset pipeline and several significant preliminary signings are expected to push-up investment volumes later in the year. &#13;

To date, ten transactions worth over €100 million have been closed in 2013 across CEE, confirming investor demand for substantial acquisitions. This trading of high quality, large lot sizes is expected to continue and will remain a driver of strong investment flows into CEE over the remainder of the year. A number of large scale properties and portfolios are anticipated to be signed soon, including the €400+ million Silesia City Center in Katowice, a large scale shopping centre acquired by a consortium led by Allianz. &#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Property investors that have been considering acquiring non-prime assets are also gradually entering CEE markets as they seek to benefit from low liquidity in the non-prime segment. Interest exists in most CEE markets; however, most profoundly in the Czech Republic and Poland.&#13;

&amp;ldquo;Investors believe that they can generate value on the back of good quality locations in combination with value-add properties, some even in regional locations.

Strong investor interest in CEE is in line with the forecasts made in CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s annual Real Estate Investor Intentions survey. The research, which is completed by more than 360 high-level respondents across the property investment community, revealed that 14% of investors view CEE as the most attractive investment choice for 2013.&#13;

“The latest Investors' sentiments survey, that CORE.XP conducted by CORE.XP in the end of Q1 2013, revealed investors' readiness to increase their investments in the Russian commercial real estate. In H1 2013 we see the realization of these intentions. Some worsening of the economic forecasts for Russia, as well as the lack of positive changes in the leading indicators of the eurozone, might cool down investment activity in H2 2013. Nonetheless, we expect that total investment volumes in 2013 might exceed 2012 figures by 10-20%.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to the latest report by CORE.XP, warehouse occupiers are the ones who set up trends on this market in Moscow and in Moscow region in 2013.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Chain retailers were the most active warehouse space occupiers. They usually absorb 20-30% of annual warehouse new supply. These companies consume about 17% of the total warehouse stock on the market. Historically, the main geographical warehouse directions are south, east and south-east. Retail was the first to consume speculative warehouse complexes in these directions. Online retail is a potential new demand driver according to the latest data from CORE.XP. In 2012 this segment absorbed about 10% of the new delivery. Its accumulated share is around 6% of the total stock.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Logistics companies as well continue to constantly grow their warehouse space stock. This segment usually absorbs around 15 -20% of the annual take-up. Logistics companies also prefer major transport directions. They choose either north or south along the main highways. Sometimes they even operate on both directions to ensure better market coverage.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;border: 0px none; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px; padding: 5px 0px 10px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP survey foreign companies do not normally buy warehouse space: their share in the total stock does not exceed 10%. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
There are several reasons for this. First of all, investment in a warehouse is a substantial capital distraction, which is often not welcomed by foreign HQs, given perceived high country risks of Russia. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Secondly, usage of the rented space is more comfortable, given that entrance in the Russian market may at the end fail. It is much easier to leave leased space than to sell previously owned warehouse property. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Finally, acquisition of a property is usually considered as a mean to decrease business risks. From this rationale, professional logistics companies have more incentives to buy warehouse space than retailers due to, for example, larger required investments in the sophisticated automated warehouse systems. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
At the same time, BTS can be more cost efficient due to the possibility to exclude unnecessary construction options and to include only required specifications already in the planning stage. Redevelopment of the existing warehouse building to meet BTS requirements is much expensive. And from on the other hand, BTS usually allows to reduce fiscal risks of developer. At the same time BTS transaction takes much more time and generally more complicated.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to the research, typical size of absorbed area in market depends on occupier’s business sector. FMCG sector, which needs huge distribution centers to organize logistics infrastructure, can be characterized by the maximum size of typical leased area – 34 thousand &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
sq m. Whereas average occupied block on the market is 16 thousand sq m.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;border: 0px none; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px; padding: 5px 0px 10px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.4em;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The latest CORE.XP research showed the new trend that first was noticed in 2007, when big purchasers and tenants occupy oversized premises. This is easy to explain, on one hand, unoccupied area is a reserve which can be used for future expansion while market faces with lack of vacant space. On another hand, this area gives opportunity to gain additional income from the market. Asking rent for sublease frequently exceeds typical lease offers by 7-10%, but it’s the easy way for tenants to find available small blocks of 1 to 2,500 sq m quickly.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP survey average rent in Moscow region depends on number of characteristics: location, type of warehouse, type of leased area and size of leased area. Thus, dry warehouse on MKAD may be offered with a base rent of USD 250 per 1 sq m per year. While asking rent for class A properties located at a distance of 30 km from MKAD is USD 135 per 1 sq m per year. Or another example, is asking rent for size less than 2 thousand sq m is 25% higher than same premises which leased as large block.&#13;

Lance Pilant, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;2013, just as the previous year, is marked by an interesting change in both the demand profile of occupiers, as well as the structure of the transactions which they are concluding with developers of Class A logistics space in the Moscow region.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retailers (including both chain operators and online trading companies), logistics companies, and FMCG companies have increased their share of the total demand for modern warehouses to nearly 75%. Production companies occupy less than 20% of the space around Moscow, due to less production activity in the region, and a higher concentration of retail development, driven by the high concentration of consumers in the Russian capital. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The structure of the transactions with these occupiers and the developers who build their units is also changing, with the BTS/purchase model now becoming much more common, versus traditional long-term leasing model. Some developers are now planning their projects to be more flexible and competitive by offering both the BTS/purchase model, and the long-term leasing model as options for new occupiers to choose from. Developers such as Radius Group and PNK Group are prime examples of this flexibility, as they offer both models when marketing their projects.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2013, up to 50% of all deals in the Moscow region may be BTS/purchase, versus 35% in 2012.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The rate at which international retailers have taken up premises in the country increased substantially in 2012 following the approval last September of foreign direct investment of up to 51% in multi-brand retailers and up to 100% in single brand retailers. The policy enables global giants to partner with local operators and sell directly to Indian consumers.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The number of global retailers entering the country will continue to grow in 2013 with retailers such as Walmart, Tesco and Ikea expected to target India. Italian jewelry brand Damiani and UK-based Paver have all been cleared to open stores in India by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, while the French cookware maker Le Creuset SA, and Thailand-based luxury goods retailer Lotus Arts de Vivre have also floated their proposals.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
On a sector basis, luxury retailers continue to drive the retail market, largely focusing on hotels and prime malls, while Fast Fashion is now the highest growth sector in India. Fast food and fine dining outlets continue to expand, as have domestic home furnishing companies and supermarkets. Most significantly, 2013 looks set to see more activity by the major international hypermarkets. &#13;

&amp;ldquo;This new measure is proving to be an incredibly important step towards attracting foreign involvement and transforming a largely untapped market and we have already identified an increase in private equity firms acquiring stakes in retail groups. Indian retail is seeing a real transformation; domestic developers&amp;rsquo; expertise in shopping mall development is steadily improving as they adopt international best practices. Leading groups are careful not to lease out malls too quickly and are becoming more selective of their retail tenants. The Indian retail market is fast becoming a major international player and 2013 will be a significant year for the retail economy.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

In Mumbai recent entrants include Pizza Express, Starbucks, Serafina, Superdry and Furla acquired space at Palladium Mall. In New Delhi, Armani Juniors, Christian Louboutin, Hackett and Roberto Cavalli Cafe all took up premises at DLF Emporio, and DLF Place became home to Crabtree &amp;amp;amp; Evelyn, Dunkin Donuts and Elle. New entrants in Bangalore include Q Cinemas, Krispy Kreme, California Pizza Kitchen, Trader Vic's, Simba Toys and Mad Over Donuts. &#13;

These three cities also saw many expansions. In Bangalore Amoeba, Hamleys and OOD Life increased their floor space at Phoenix Market City, while Blu O and Debenhams expanded into new space at Brigade Orion Mall. Mumbai saw expansions for Hamleys, Elle, F Bar, and Bally and in New Delhi, expansions included Thomas Pink, Claire's, Dunkin Donuts, Keihl's, Body Shop, Gucci, Bebe, and Armani Jeans .&#13;

While the more affluent parts of Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi have seen the greatest increase in foreign brands to date, well-established international mass market brands are entering secondary locations due to the lack of space in major markets. Popular new markets are also emerging in Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and Chandigarh. 2013 will also see the completion of new supply in South Delhi and Noida. &#13;

Besides parliamentary approval to the legislation permitting foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in December, the Union Budget 2013-14 also welcomed foreign investment across sectors including retail, with the Finance Minister suggesting that foreign investment flows are critical to bridging the fiscal gap in the economy. This is important from the point of view of generating positive sentiment in the investor community. The budget also allocated about INR 5,000 crore for National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) for the development of logistics facilities, warehouses and cold storage infrastructure across the country.&#13;

“This will promote development of retail back-end infrastructure, which is a backbone of organized retail, and will also support growth in the e-commerce industry. Similarly, sustained focus on infrastructure schemes such as Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) will continue to build institutional capacities for infrastructure development in the country, which will propel economic growth in the long run.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

CORE.XP analysed a range of &amp;lsquo;good secondary shopping centres&amp;rsquo;* across Europe to identify the most important factors that contribute to a centre’s success. The research reveals that the quality of tenant mix is by far the most important factor ahead of good car access/parking and the ability to draw from a substantial catchment. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tenant mix, and the presence of ‘high profile’ retailers, is the main reason why consumers shop in a particular location. Managers identified the three most sought-after retailers in their shopping centres – those that generate the biggest footfall. Regardless of size or standing in the retail hierarchy, each centre boasts key ‘anchors’ such as Zara, Primark or H&amp;amp;amp;M. This demonstrates that many ‘high profile’ retailers have wide ranging store portfolios that include both prime and secondary locations. &#13;

This confirms the findings of CORE.XP’s recent report - How We Shop: Inside the Minds of Europe’s Consumer – that reveals shoppers’ strong preference for using their cars for both food and fashion shopping.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The research shows that good secondary shopping centres operate in all types of location: neighbourhood, district, sub-regional and regional. While the size of the catchment is considered an important factor, this is largely incidental to the success of the centre – it is the ability to capture spending from within this catchment. ‘Good’ secondary shopping centres also tend to have wealthier customers.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
Albert Hoogland, Executive Director, Shopping Centre Management, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Shopping centre managers can have a significant impact on the success of a centre, particularly if this is backed up by regular investment to keep the centre fresh and competitive. It is notable that the majority of successful centres either opened or had major refurbishments in the last 10 years, many of which were in the last five years. Conversely, poorer performing secondary centres typically suffer from a lack of investment, which is often connected to the ownership structure of the centre.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
“It is clear that one size does not fit all - good secondary shopping centres can be large or small and operate in neighbourhood, district and regional locations. What does unite them is the ability to either dominate their catchment or capture sufficient spend from this catchment. To achieve this, a strong tenant mix is vital and needs to be appropriate for the size of the scheme and demographic profile of the area. Good car parking and access is also important, while cleanliness and security are considered a given by consumers - they must be done well.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The location of a shopping centre within its urban environment is rated slightly more highly in the UK and The Netherlands where having a good location in a town or city is a pre-requisite. Italian shopping centres tend to be located in suburban or out-of-town locations which explains the relatively low rating. Good public transport is clearly an important success factor for some centres. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;
The level of competition in the town varied significantly, depending on the type of centre, the function it performs and the centre’s dominance within its catchment. In the larger cities, secondary shopping centres typically face substantial competition from other retailers, but this competition contributes to the critical mass and overall attraction of the city. Thus, if the secondary centre has sufficiently strong characteristics to attract shoppers, the nearby competition can also be considered as complementary.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;background-color: transparent;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&#13;

“In Russia, including Moscow, competition is much lower compared to Western Europe. As a result, a scope of potential “success factors” is much wider. Quite a lot of retail schemes generate high yields even without strong tenant mix. Location nearby transportation hub, few competitors in a catchment area, or tough traffics jams on the way to the competing landmark retail schemes are significant contributors to this situation. It is not expected to change significantly even in the next 3-5 years.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 18 November 2013 &amp;ndash; The reshaping of supply chains boosted by rapid growth in online retailing is contributing to a significant increase in demand for XXL warehouses (+ 50,000 sq m), according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A range of factors is driving the remodeling of logistics networks, such as a growth in the number of product lines and order complexity, customer demand for quicker delivery times, and the need for flexibility to cope with demand volatility. These are particularly relevant for supply chains that support growth in online retailing. Occupier demand for larger schemes also reflects a growing realisation that supply chains, when efficiently managed, are a strategic asset that can boost profitability for retailers and others.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;These drivers have pushed take-up of XXL warehouses in Europe above 4 million sq m in the 18 months from the beginning of 2012. This represents around 14% of the total industrial market compared with 5-6% in the two years from 2010-2011.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the major European markets, take-up of XXL warehouses rose to over 2.5 million sq m in 2012 and is running at a similar level in the first half of 2013. Take-up had previously been running at 1-1.5 million sq m per year throughout 2010-11. While the UK, France and Germany dominate, XXL warehouses are accounting for a growing proportion of total leasing activity throughout Europe.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Amaury Gariel, Head of EMEA Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We are undoubtedly seeing growth in demand for XXL warehouses arising from supply chain reconfiguration and the consolidation of operations into fewer, larger centralised hubs. These hubs supply a large hinterland area more cost-effectively than might be possible from traditional networks.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Online retailing remains a significant driver of logistics activity and its future growth will introduce significant challenges and opportunities for networks. This shift will require the development of more specialised platforms that will need to cope with an ever-growing customer demand for more cost-effective delivery options.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The growth in online retailing – and the associated needs for better process capability, the rising number of permutations for order and fulfilment, and more efficient inventory management – is generating rising occupier demand for larger buildings. As a result, the retail sector – including online retail - accounted for more than two-thirds of take-up in XXL warehouses from 2010-2013. Such large units also allow for better information management, closer links with the customer base and give retailers a unique understanding of consumer buying behavior.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Third party logistics operators (3PLs) also accounted for a significant amount of take-up in XXL warehouses (22%) over this time period. As 3PLs will usually be operating on behalf of one or more contract customers, this figure probably understates the contribution of retailers to overall demand.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The sector is also attracting interest from investors. XXL warehouses have accounted for nearly 20% of the European industrial property investment market since the beginning of 2012, with the UK, France and Germany again to the fore. Investor demand for larger schemes is also growing strongly in Asia Pacific and the Americas where there are strong indications that large pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors regard this type of asset as an opportunity to deploy capital on a scale that would otherwise involve multiple acquisitions.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The scale of activity reflects widespread recognition by investors of the structural shift by supply chain managers and retailers towards larger schemes. It also indicates that the yield premium applied by some investors to reflect liquidity and re-letting risks may narrow over time.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Lance Pilant, Director, Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Agency Services in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In Moscow I&amp;amp;amp;L market the share of XXL deal accounted to more than 20% of the total transactions volume. This is more than 50% above European indicator. This demand came from the different segments: retailers, production, and logistics companies. Online retailers generate around 10% of the total demand for warehouse space in Moscow. Thus, XXL transactions are not typical for this segment yet. Share of e-commerce in Retail sales in Russia is twice less compared to the European indicator. Fast rates of growth in this segment might generate demand for XXL warehouse space in the nearest future.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 20 November 2013, &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, the global property advisor, announces the launch of its new service line called Workplace Strategy.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Our workplace often changes on the back of the operational and processing technologies. In the immediate future people will be able to work from any part of the world without physically being at their work stations. Today, developed countries gradually move away from the &amp;ldquo;traditional office&amp;rdquo; to the so called “agile office” concept. The idea behind it is that the office space should reflect the understanding of the office functionality rather than quantitative characteristics such as number of employees and cabinets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The new service is designed to make the office space cost effective for an employer and comfortable for current and potential employees. The office should have modern technologies and facilities making communication between employees easier and faster so that a company&amp;rsquo;s business is more efficient and high performing. It should have different types of workplaces to fit different business needs.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2013, CORE.XP Project Management team in Russia carried out a study for a big Russian corporation. The study aimed to conduct current workplace occupancy measurements, office development strategy for construction of new headquarters with the office area of 20,000 sq m. The results of the study demonstrated that during peak hours the work stations were occupied by 67% only, with 490 vacant work stations. In the meantime, the accurate workplace strategy might reach savings of 1.5 million dollar in the company’s yearly budget.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP worldwide has been successfully developing this business line for already more than 10 years. In Russia, in the last year the Project Management team has already executed several pilot projects for Russian and International companies, with the office areas of 20,000 sq m, 5,000 sq m, and 3,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mikhail Kaplun, Director of the Project Management department, and Pavel Yakimchuk, Deputy Director, are heading the new business line. Both are experts in the sphere of architecture, planning and construction with more than 10-years’ experience. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“We are proud that along with our colleagues from the UK and the Netherlands, who are the Workplace Strategy pioneers in the world, we are able to deliver this service to our clients here in Russia. We are confident that we provide our clients with the high-quality service as we ground our execution on many years’ experience and competence of our overseas colleagues and on our in-depth knowledge of the Russian market nature”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Los Angeles, CA, - Moscow, 22 November 2013 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland), a leading provider of commercial building technical engineering services in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, for &amp;pound;250 million (approximately $400 million) plus up to £50 million (approximately $80 million) of deferred contingent consideration as well as a payment for excess working capital and related items. The purchase price is payable in cash, except for £5.6 million (approximately $9 million) that is payable in CORE.XP common stock to Norland senior management. The acquisition will add market-leading capabilities for CORE.XP to self-perform building technical engineering services in its UK and European Global Corporate Services (GCS) business, providing its client base with fully-integrated outsourcing services in the region. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Norland, founded in London in 1984, provides building technical engineering services to commercial real estate owners and occupiers primarily in the UK and Ireland and also has a growing roster of customers in the United States and Singapore. Norland is particularly well known for its expertise in critical environments, such as data centers and trading floors - a growing market segment requiring specialized knowledge and experience. Its 4,000 employees in 14 offices serve more than 300 clients.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Bill Concannon, CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s CEO of GCS, said: &amp;ldquo;Norland is a strong complement to our global platform. We will have the ability to self-perform building technical engineering services in Europe, as we already do for more than 850 million sq. ft. of client properties in North America, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This transaction will significantly enhance our service offering, enable us to provide an integrated suite of outsourcing services and deepen our relationships with global and multi-national occupiers.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Norland significantly advances our corporate outsourcing offering in Europe,” said Mike Strong, CORE.XP’s CEO of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa). “The Norland team has built an exceptional reputation for managing the building technical engineering elements of occupier and investor portfolios. By combining our complementary expertise we will be able to offer clients unrivalled access to a fully-integrated, best-in-class suite of real estate services in the region.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Following the closing of the transaction, Norland’s existing operations will operate as CORE.XP | Norland, reflecting the combined strengths of CORE.XP’s prominent global brand and Norland’s reputation for expertise in building technical engineering services. Norland serves a blue-chip roster of clients, many of which are also served by CORE.XP. Norland provides services on a number of CORE.XP-managed accounts, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and State Street Corporation. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Our firms fit together very well, both culturally and operationally,” said Ian Entwisle, CEO of Norland. “We know each other well, and both firms are highly focused on delivering exceptional customer service and value. By uniting our building technical engineering expertise with CORE.XP’s broad service offering and global reach, we foresee significant opportunities to expand our client base and accelerate our growth.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“A large near-term opportunity is to bring Norland’s services to CORE.XP’s client base in continental Europe”, added Mr. Entwisle, who will lead the CORE.XP | Norland operations as CEO.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Norland reported revenue of £385 million (approximately $616 million) for its fiscal year ended April 5, 2013. Revenue has grown at a double-digit rate every year over the last ten years with revenue and profit growth over this period exceeding a 20% compound annual growth rate. Growth has come from corporations turning over the management of their real estate to the highest quality third-party specialists. Norland typically serves clients under long-term contracts. High-value integrated client services with steady year-over-year growth fits nicely within CORE.XP’s growth strategy.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP anticipates that the transaction will be moderately accretive to its earnings immediately and expects to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. CORE.XP ended the third quarter of 2013 with more than $500 million of cash on its balance sheet and approximately $1.1 billion available on its revolving credit facility.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Norland acquisition is expected to close before year end 2013 and is subject to clearance from the European Commission. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as sole financial advisor to CORE.XP, and Simpson Thacher &amp;amp;amp; Bartlett LLP acted as CORE.XP’s legal advisors. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 26 November 2013 &amp;ndash; Emerging markets are offering interesting investment opportunities in terms of shopping centre development and existing assets, according to the latest Global ViewPoint released by CORE.XP. It suggests that lack of suitable shopping centre product, particularly pronounced in mature markets across the globe, is prompting greater expansion into emerging markets by shopping centre developers and investors than is the case for other commercial property types.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a result, CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s Research and Valuation &amp;amp;amp; Advisory teams have developed a Global Shopping Centre Yield Benchmark: Emerging Markets (GSCYB) to provide greater market transparency in these often opaque markets. The key aim of the GSCYB tool is to provide a theoretical basis for the evaluation of pricing in emerging markets, and to compare against current valuation yields to identify potential mispricing. The study comprises a wide range of emerging markets, from the very nascent ones such as Armenia through to the UAE, which has a number of world class shopping centres, but is yet to develop in terms of investment market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Graham Hughes, Executive Director of Valuation &amp;amp;amp; Advisory at CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Valuing shopping centre assets in emerging markets, where there is little or no transactional activity, can be challenging. This is why we developed this global model. Of the 27 emerging markets we looked at most were fairly priced; however we did identify twelve markets with significant differences between modelled and current valuation yields. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The common thread in the results is that the broad-level country risk factors – such as political and sovereign risk and corruption – dominate shopping centre pricing in emerging markets. The GSCYB results show that, when it comes to emerging markets, these have far greater impact on investor decision-making than, for example, consumer demand or real estate specific factors.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Iryna Pylypchuk, Associate Director, EMEA Research and Consulting, adds:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“As well as country risk, there are also differing local factors which help to explain the variations between current valuation yields and the modelled results. In some of the markets lack of quality product offers a simple explanation as to why prime yields are not as low as we would expect. This is the case in Armenia, for example, where the market is so nascent, that the opportunities are pretty much confined to development.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The degree of internationalisation – be it at the broader FDI level or specific to real estate – is another vital component. India and Argentina restrict inward investment, preventing international investors from driving down yields. In contrast, the weight of local capital in China and Nigeria has the opposite effect – pushing yields below where the risk profile of these markets suggests an international investor would price them.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: “Developed methodology of valuation of shopping malls in the emerging markets may become a useful market tool. Its benefit is especially noticeable for the Russian market, where details of transactions are almost never disclosed in a manner, which is convenient to exploit them as market benchmarks. Moreover, econometric model provided another one empirical evidence for the opinion that sovereign risks and corruption are the key obstacles for assets growth in emerging markets. It is reduction of these risks where the government can bring the key value for the national business.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Global Shopping Centre Yield Benchmark model is a multiple regression model where current net equivalent yield (as assessed by CORE.XP’s valuers) in each country is the dependent variable. The potential explanatory variables analysed fall into three main categories – risk, demand and real estate. The 27 emerging markets covered are truly global, spanning across Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Latin America. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Emerging markets covered in the benchmark include:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 27 November 2013 &amp;ndash; Capital continues to flow into Industrial and Logistics real estate, with investment volumes rising 4.6% in Q3 2013, and nearly 40% on the same period last year, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The European industrial and logistics market has attracted just over &amp;euro;10 billion worth of investment to date in 2013, surpassing the full year total for each of the past four years. There was once again significant transaction activity in the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands. Prime yields have edged down in some markets, most notably in the UK.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;James Markby, Head of European Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Investment, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The entry of predominantly North American private equity funds has injected liquidity into a market that offers attractive risk-adjusted returns secured against diversified income streams. We are also seeing the re-entry of institutional players seeking to access the light industrial market to enhance their distribution yields. Investors are also taking advantage of a pronounced improvement in secondary industrial values across the major European markets.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The European economic background continues to slow the decision process for industrial and logistics development projects. This is exerting upward pressure on rents at the prime end of some markets, as well as keeping vacancy rates for good stock low. As a result, there are some cases of new stock coming to market in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and being absorbed immediately. In Moscow, 526,000 sq m of warehouse space was delivered in Q3 2013, and another 207,000 sq m is expected to complete in Q4 2013, with 90% of this pre-let. Prague also saw the highest level of completions since Q2 2009. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Leasing activity in the industrial and logistics sector in Q3 2013 was similar to the first half of the year, but with notable increases in some markets. There was strong activity once again in Moscow and Dublin, but also the Lille region in France and the regional Czech Republic markets. Consolidation and relocation of occupiers into prime space is continuing to drive demand across EMEA. Overall, take-up was down a little on Q2 2013, and is running below the four quarter rolling average. As a result, 2013 is likely to be down on 2012 levels. Headline rents edged up on the quarter and the year by 0.64%, as increases were seen in Oslo, Glasgow, The Hague and Dubai.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Amaury Gariel, Head of EMEA Industrial and Logistics, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The near term outlook for the industrial and logistics sector appears stable and is generally more upbeat than six months ago. The expansion of e-commerce by retailers is one segment of the market in particular that is showing sustained growth, generating demand for both parcel delivery centres and large distribution warehouses. Demand for warehouse space in western Europe is being driven by the desire to improve supply chain networks with the ultimate goal of boosting profits, while in Eastern Europe demand is the result of long-term growth plans through the expansion of store networks.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In 2013 Moscow will witness 1 mln sq m of newly delivered warehouse space. It will be the record high since 2007. Demand structure remains balanced with retail and logistics operators traditionally dominating. Increase in demand from production and e-commerce companies is a noticeable feature of 2013. Another detail to be mentioned is growing relative share of large transactions, i.e. 20,000+ sq m and larger. Current decreasing rates of Russian GDP growth may slightly calm down the market in 2014. However, we remain optimistic with current high activity trends expected to continue.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 3 December 2013 &amp;ndash; Commercial real estate investors are showing greater appetite for risk in Europe as the overall market continues to grow and the recovery in both Ireland and Spain gathers pace, according to the latest data from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The trend of increasing commercial real estate investment that has been emerging in Europe over the course of this year continued in Q3 2013. Total investment reached &amp;euro;35.7 billion in Q3 2013 – an increase of 21% on the same quarter last year. This is also the highest quarterly total since Q1 2008, excluding the Q4 spikes of year-end investment activity. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Led by improving economic conditions and increased investor interest, significant growth in real transactional activity is apparent in Europe&amp;rsquo;s recovering markets, namely Spain and Ireland. Over the past eighteen months, Ireland in particular has seen a significant increase in investment levels. In Q3 2013 Ireland saw investment reach €462 million, compared to just €102 million in the same quarter last year, while the last 12 months have seen €1.33 billion worth of transactions. With €1,321 million worth of transactions in Q3 2013, investment in Spain is more than double the level seen in Q3 2012 at €531 million.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Marie Hunt, Executive Director, Research, CORE.XP Ireland, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The volume of transactional activity in the Irish commercial real estate market in 2013 surprised many, with volumes more than trebling year-on-year as the process of deleveraging picked up pace to meet investor demand for Irish investment opportunities. We expect to see a similar volume of transactional activity occurring in 2014 as banks, borrowers and NAMA continue to bring assets to the market and some of the properties sold by way of loan sales in recent years start to be unwound.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The core investment markets of the UK, Germany and France were still dominant in Q3 2013. Commercial real estate activity in the UK reached levels that have not been seen since 2007, with over €14 billion worth of transactions in Q3 2013 compared with €11.4 billion in Q2 2013. France also saw a significant increase in investment quarter-on-quarter, with Q3 2013 at €4.6 billion - €1 billion more in activity than Q2 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Head of EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Europe had an impressive third quarter in terms of investment activity and this trend is expected to continue in the final quarter of 2013. While core markets remain strong, with the UK showing remarkable levels of investment in Q3, sentiment continues to improve in Europe’s recovering markets such as Ireland and Spain. There is greater risk appetite in the real estate investment community, with many private equity groups seeking high yielding opportunities.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: “Eurozone GDP growth, coming back to positive figures, together with the first signs of decreasing unemployment rates will signal about the end of the world economic crisis of 2008 – 2013. Foreseeing this signal, investors increase their risk appetite in order not to miss the start of a new cycle in assets’ prices growth. Investments in the European commercial real estate are still just 50-70% of the pre-crisis volumes, i.e. growth potential in investment volumes is still considerable. Investors in the Russian commercial real estate started their acquisitions much earlier. In 2013 we might see 10-20% growth in their operations. Government’s ability to turnaround decreasing GDP growth rates is a key Russian macroeconomic concern now.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 17 January 2014 &amp;ndash; The majority of retailers will increase store openings and seek to create larger experiential stores to drive footfall in 2014 as a direct result of their multichannel strategies, according to a new study by global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP carried out a survey among 50 leading international retailers to identify their current strategies for multichannel retail and how they saw this developing in future. The survey identified:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Retailers’ future demand for physical stores;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The research found that as a direct result of their digital strategies nearly all retailers (87%) feel they will see an increase in the overall revenue of their business, with the majority (80%) expecting an increase in foot traffic in stores. A significant amount of retailers (40%) anticipate a need for more stores in the future and expect to increase store openings.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Digital technology is an integral part of a retailer’s armoury. Nearly all of the retailers surveyed (85%) now have a dedicated resource to run their digital strategies and the vast majority (87%) operate a transactional website. Digital technology is also being used by retailers to drive customers to their stores via social media and the use of smart phone apps and geo-localisation. Most retailers are seeking to create larger experiential stores featuring digital tools such as iPads for ordering online and digital screens to show the full range of goods.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Neville Moss, Head of EMA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;In the digital age, it is more important than ever that retailers understand their brand and the way it engages with consumers. Advances in technology provide an increasing range of tools to do this, and consequently those retailers that do embrace digital technology will have the best chance of success. This is true throughout the retail spectrum, from food to fashion and from luxury to value.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Successful digital strategies clearly require investment; not only the cost of technology, but also for hiring and training staff to implement this, and the reorganisation of the business model in line with this. This in-store investment in new technologies is essential in order to &amp;lsquo;stay ahead’ of the competition.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;40% of retailers will increase store openings as a result of their digital strategy. Only 20% of retailers predicted that they would reduce the number of stores in their portfolio. The remaining 40% said it would make no difference.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;When entering new markets, retailers are using a range of strategies. While 40% would typically open a physical store and an online platform together, just under one third (30%) said that they would first test a market with an online platform before committing to a physical store.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Some 76% of retailers intend to increase the geographical coverage of their transactional websites in future.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Value of Multichannel to Overall Business:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Most retailers (66%) felt that increasing the overall sales turnover of the business by attracting more customers (both online and offline) was the main goal of their digital strategy.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;•&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Only 13% said it was primarily about generating income through their transactional site and another 13% felt the greatest value was as a marketing strategy to drive footfall to their stores.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Analyst, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Today digital technologies could certainly add value for all retailers of different format and segment. Multichannel sales in Russia become more popular among many retailers. “W&amp;amp;amp;B” retailers are the first ones to follow this trend:  Media Markt launched online sales, M.Video opened first “dark store”, Eldorado started sales in format of “e-hypermarket”. During the last months many international retailers like Apple, Lacoste, Motivi, Tommy Hilfiger, Zara launched official online stores in Russia. Retailers also expend their activity in social networks. Growing competition between both retail locations and retailers could lead to strengthening of this trend in the next 2-3 years.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 20 January 2014 Corporate decision makers are responding to signs of economic improvement across Europe by shifting focus away from pure cost management to future growth opportunities, according to the latest annual European Occupier Survey1 by global real estate advisor, CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The survey, now in its fourth year, polls corporate real estate decision makers at global corporations collectively occupying approximately 2.7 billion sq ft (250 million sq m) worldwide. The survey shows corporates&amp;rsquo; increased confidence in the economic recovery, with less than half [46%] identifying weak economies as a concern. In 2012 the overwhelming majority [70%], reported that the uncertain economic outlook in Europe was a key factor in their real estate strategy, with cost management being the primary objective. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite such positive signs, cost control remains a priority for corporates. The survey shows almost three quarters [72%] renegotiated leases in the past twelve months [compared to 45% in 2012], to &amp;lsquo;lock in’ deals while office rents are at, or close to, the bottom of the market. However, such efforts to reduce costs are likely to diminish as the recovery continues. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In addition, 61% of companies reported that they have reduced their real estate footprint by occupying space more efficiently. Such space optimisation strategies are increasingly prominent for corporates due to the balancing act between cost savings (reported by 56% as a key driver of alternative workplace strategies) and providing a collaborative working environment (39%) with the aim of improving employee productivity (37%). It is therefore interesting to see that the vast majority of companies are not widely adopting remote working strategies with 75% reporting that less than a quarter of staff work flexibly on a regular basis. This indicates that the office environment is still key which explains the focus on improving the quality of the workplace. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This leads to companies placing greater emphasis on providing staff with the right environment in the right locations. Although cost is the principal factor when companies choose office space [cited by 85%], 45% of companies report that they see the quality of their workspace as integral to attracting and retaining talent. In turn, 73% or three quarters believe public transport accessibility is important to staff, with the provision of ‘value-add’ amenities such as an on-site gym or restaurant [48%] and flexible workspace [48%] also important. Overall, the results indicate that for occupiers, a central, amenity-rich location which provides lifestyle options for the workforce outside the work environment is crucial.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As the economic outlook improves, multi-national companies are demonstrating an appetite for international expansion into new markets. The survey demonstrates this with more than half of corporates [56%] naming access to new markets and customers as the principal driver for location decisions. This broad appetite for expansion sees India and Africa emerge as destinations of choice. When asked to identify where they intended to expand their operations, 48% named India (double the figure from 2012 at 24%), with China mentioned by 42%, down from 60% in 2012. There is also a significant increase in the number of corporates intending to expand into Africa. This target market is now identified by a third of respondents [34% today], versus a fifth [21% in 2012].  In the case of both India and Africa, rapid population and economic growth, coupled with increasing transparency and improving infrastructure, is removing many of the traditional barriers to entry.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The shift in corporate focus towards the future is also re-focusing attention of the corporate real estate (&amp;ldquo;CRE&amp;rdquo;) function. There is now a greater desire for increased alignment between real estate activities and broader business objectives with 72% of companies surveyed noting this as an area for improvement. This indicates that with the correct management, CRE functions could become facilitators of future growth with the knock-on-effect of increased CRE outsourcing. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mark Caskey, EMEA Head of Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“As we move into a phase of economic recovery it is clear that occupiers are beginning to look beyond pure cost saving initiatives. In the near term we expect a broad cost saving attitude to prevail, however, it is encouraging that corporates are seeking out new target destinations and adopting increasingly sophisticated workplace strategies.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In particular, a core theme throughout our results has been the increasing influence and focus on workplace strategies. It is clear corporates are sitting up and taking note that ideal working environments lead to better employee productivity and enable the best talent to be attracted and retained. Furthermore, labour outlay is more expensive than real estate costs, so improved staff productivity has a greater impact on companies’ profitability. We expect this trend to continue next year and beyond.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Director, EMEA Research, at CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“While financial objectives still govern the corporate occupier landscape, increasingly there is a greater desire to look toward the future. This has seen a greater alignment between real estate activities and broader business objectives. As corporate real estate teams become more strategic and client focused, scope remains for the trend of outsourcing to persist.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The crucial factor for the decision to move lays not only in commercial terms, but also in employees’ work environment, location, public transport accessibility, especially because of the Moscow traffic and payable parking places inside Garden ring. That's why our clients prefer to stay in current premises, but implement workplace strategy to raise business efficiency, for example, by generating new collaboration areas, space optimization, implementing rooms for telephone conversations, organize flexible work places, etc.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Corporate clients prefer to extend their current lease agreements for 3 years in average to have an opportunity to catch the pick of new construction.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London- Moscow, 29 January 2014 &amp;ndash; Falling yields across all property sectors and a further slight increase in rental values provides further evidence of growing momentum in European commercial real estate markets, according to the latest research from CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The findings from CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s Q4 2013 survey of prime rents and yields backs up the picture of strengthening investment markets across the region, which have benefitted from strong capital flows into the sector and growing indications of economic recovery.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP’s EMEA Prime Yield Indices edged lower over Q4 2013 in the office and retail sectors by between seven and ten basis points, while yields in the industrial sector saw a fall of more than 20 basis points reflecting widespread improvement in the core western European markets and a significant rise in investment levels in the sector. Industrial yields moved lower in nearly half of the markets covered including the UK, France and Germany, but also Spain and Italy. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the office market, yields moved lower in the key City and West End of London markets as well some of the UK regional markets and all the main German markets. Dublin, which is undergoing a rapid recovery, saw yields move 25 basis points lower in the quarter, and they are now fully 100 basis points lower than at the end of 2012. Retail yield movements were more widespread, with small changes recorded across the main German markets, and larger falls in Spain, Italy and parts of the UK outside London.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While the economic backdrop for occupational markets is increasingly positive, rental movements remain modest so far. Growth is most evident in the retail markets, with shopping centre rents up by almost 3% on the quarter and high street retail rents up by nearly 1%. Retail rent increases were mostly concentrated in the stronger northern European markets, including Germany, Scandinavia and the UK. Rental increases were less widespread in the office and industrial sectors: notable increases include the office markets the City of London, Munich and Dublin office markets. Prime Dublin office rents are now up by over 25% year-on-year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Director, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The yield movements recorded in the fourth quarter represent an acceleration of the trends we have seen in recent quarters, and reflect very strong levels of investment interest in the European property market last year, particularly the second half. The movement in industrial and logistics yields reflects the very sharp rise in investment turnover in the sector last year, resulting in pricing shifts in most of the major western European markets. Overall, rental growth remains patchy, and is most evident in the prime retail sector, but with economic indicators improving, we expect it to become more widespread.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Office yields across EMEA fell during Q4 2013. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index fell by eight basis points in the quarter, and is now 19 bps lower than a year ago. Fifteen of the 55 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter, 36 remained unchanged and four rose. The most significant yield reductions were in Lisbon and Istanbul, each of which saw 50 bps falls. A number of other markets saw 25 bps movements, including Dublin and both the West End and City markets in London. The largest rise was in Rome, up 25bps to 6.5%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retail yields also moved lower in Q4 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail Yield Index down by ten basis points, leaving it 21 basis points lower than a year ago. Yields fell in 18 locations and remained static in the remaining 33. The largest yield reductions (-50bps) were recorded in Madrid and Edinburgh with smaller falls in a number of locations including Milan, Copenhagen and the main German markets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Industrial yields fell in Q4 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Yield Index down by 22 basis points in the quarter, and 34 bps over the year. Yields fell in 22 locations, including a 70 bps fall in London and smaller changes in other UK markets as well as Spain, Italy and Germany. The only increase was recorded in Helsinki, up 10 bps to 7.3%. In the remaining 24 locations yields were static.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime office rents across Europe rose marginally in Q4 2013 and the same is true in year-on-year terms. Over the fourth quarter, eight of the 55 markets in the survey saw increases in prime rents, 45 remained unchanged, and two fell. The largest increase was in Dublin (up 17%), and the City of London and Munich also rose. The largest fall was in Geneva (-2.5%).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime retail rents were up 0.8% in Q4 2013, leaving the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail Rent Index 6% higher than a year ago. Twelve of the 51 markets surveyed registered an increase, 38 remained unchanged, and one fell. The largest increases (over 9%) were recorded in Bucharest and Birmingham. London’s West End also saw rents improve (up 4.0%). The only faller was Bratislava, down 7%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime industrial rents rose marginally in Q4 2013, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up by 0.4% in the quarter, and almost 1% in year-on-year terms. Four of the 47 sample locations rose, one fell and the remainder stayed unchanged. The largest increase was in Dubai (up 11.8%), and the only faller was Athens (down 7%).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;

 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In 2013 investments in the European CRE increased by more than 20%, having reflected grown investors’ optimism on perspectives of Eurozone economy recovery. This revival in investment demand naturally generates upward pressure on the prices. We witnessed this growth in about 30% of the observed markets in office and retail segments. In logistics the situation was even about – around 50% of the markets. Weak growth of rental rates proves that Eurozone economic recovery is currently on the earliest stages. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite a very high investment activity in Russia, market indicators there remain stable in terms of both yields and rental rates.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 28 January 2013, &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor, announces research findings identifying the Interchange Hubs that are mostly attractive for retail development in Moscow. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the plans of the Moscow Government, 255 Interchange Hubs (IHs) of two types will be completed in Moscow by 2020: one-level IHs – park and ride type; multi-level IHs with such additional services as waiting rooms, retail, food and beverage, etc. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Based on the company&amp;rsquo;s global experience CORE.XP defined three criteria for assessment of IHs in terms of their attractiveness for further retail development: 1) size of passenger flows; 2) amount and types of public transport; 3) existing shopping malls in close proximity to an IH. CORE.XP divided all the large-scale Moscow IHs into the three possible models of development in terms of the commercial real estate that exist around the world: 1) IHs inside the building, 2) IHs at stations on the Moscow Railway Ring and 3) at metro stations with high passenger flows. As a result of this division CORE.XP defined the leader in each of the group, these are IHs on Komsomolskaya, Tekstilshiki and Schelkovskaya respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Apart from the three models mentioned above there is also a model of IH in the metro station. But it is very important to understand that at underground stations with a passenger flow of less than 50,000 people a day it is sufficient to have a limited retail offer. CORE.XP gives London underground as an example of this model of IH. Retail is represented mostly in a kiosk format, generally, located near ticket offices and in crosswalks. The typical size of a kiosk is 7-12 sq m. Kiosks near the station are usually around 30-50 sq m. However, minimarket formats with space of around 100 sq m is also very common. It should be noted that London’s government plan to attract some major chain retailers to underground stations and implement new technologies based on online shopping (for example, to enable customers to pick up shopping ordered online from underground stations). According to the research London government there are plans to increase the presence of chain retailers such as WH Smith, Caff&amp;egrave; Nero, John Lewis, and Tesco (this is to be done by offering special commercial terms). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Special attention is paid in the research to the share of retail space in the total IH project as well as tenant mix, both indicators reflect total passenger flow.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In &amp;lsquo;strong’ IHs that include 3-5 types of public transport in addition to railway (bus, metro or tram, suburban trains, shuttles to the airport, etc.) the retail element is twice as large as IHs that include 1 or 2 types of public transport. The proportion of retail space in the project may be from 7% to 20-30%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In ‘strong’ IHs the number of the shops is usually 1.5 – 2 times more than in the weak ones.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In terms of tenant mix the majority of IHs consist of cafes and restaurants (30-40%), around 20% of IH tenants are pharmacies, newspaper and magazines stands, book-kiosks and other mass market merchandise. The share of fashion and shoe stores is growing together with the development of IHs. It may reach 20-25% of the total number of stores in IH.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Analyst, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Competition in Moscow’s retail property market increases steadily. As a result, the task of finding a proper location for a new shopping mall becomes more and more complicated. According to global practice, interchange hubs (IH) are often provide attractive opportunities for retail development, aiming to serve larger passengers flows. Depending on the type of IH, the retail part can follow one of three models: development within the railway station itself (Birmingham, UK, case), complex urban development (King’s Cross and St. Pancras districts of London), or development inside an interchange hub (South Kensington station in London). The last one is the most widespread. Moscow’s government can reduce public investment in improvement of the transportation system via creation of favorable conditions for interested investors.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 27 January 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP announces that the companies Pervoye Resheniye and Natura Siberica signed 5-year lease agreements at the business center &amp;ldquo;Leninskiy Prospekt, 119&amp;rdquo; and have relocated to their new office space already. The companies occupy 1,618 sq m and 916 sq m respectively. Pervoye Resheniye and Natura Siberica are the first tenants to move into this new class A business center. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The building&amp;rsquo;s rentable area is 15,400 sq m. The office premises are fitted-out using high quality materials and ready to move in. “Leninskiy Prospekt, 119” has recently obtained Green Building Certificate in Gold (DGNB) by the German Sustainable Building Council.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The business center is located within a few steps from the city park and its tenants will enjoy an ecological environment in addition to a well-developed infrastructure of this prestigious district. It has an easy access both by car and public transport. New metro station “Troparevo” is due to open in September 2014, and until it’s open the shuttle bus service to Yugo-Zapadnaya metro is provided to tenants. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The parking ratio in the building is 1/62 sq m which is above average parking ratio in any other similar property in the city center. There will be a canteen and a shop operating for tenants in the business center. Besides, the business center offers archive and storage premises for the use of tenants. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Located in a premium part of Moscow “Leninskiy Prospekt, 119”, a high-quality business center, offers its tenants an exceptional option to move in without much hassle and heavy investments into fit-out which is so uncommon for the Moscow real estate market. Now that we’ve had the first tenants moving in just makes it easier for others to follow and sign up until the whole vacancy is gone”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 24 January 2013, &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor, announces research findings for the Leningradskiy submarket in Moscow.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Geographically Leningradskiy business district is limited by Belarusskiy railway station in the south-east, it continues along the Leningradskoe Highway up to MKAD in the north-west, while the southern border lies along Marshal Zhukov Avenue, Horoshevskoe Highway and Begovaya Street.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the latest study, out of 318 companies that chose to locate their headquarters in this area 148 are foreign. The total area of office space leased by the largest players is between 10 and 18 thousand sq. m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Attractiveness of this business district is driven by good transport accessibility and environmental conditions, effectively integrated services in business centres and attractive rental rates, which are lower than in the CBD and Moscow-City.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Leningradskiy submarket is the largest source of Class A office supply after Central Business District and Moscow-City. In 2014 delivery of four large business centres is expected in the Leningradskiy area. This will create an offer of approximately 150,000 sq m of office space, or 15% of the existing supply which can create a splash of opportunistic vacancy. However, given high demand for office space, including from Western companies, a steady decline in vacancy over subsequent periods is expected. Within the past 5 years the volume of annual take-up has been 10-20% of the total supply in the area.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Currently, total vacancy in the Leningradskiy submarket is 11% (about 109,000 sq m), 41% of which is in Class A buildings. Class B vacancy totals 64,000 sq m, most of which are units measuring up to 1,000 sq m. However, only 7-8 (10%) business centres have large areas available for potential tenants. For instance, business centres Avion (47, Leningradskiy Avenue), Diapason (10, Volokolamskiy 1st Passage) and Trio (1, 8 Marta Street).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Leningradskiy business district is the third highest in terms of lease rates after the Central Business District and Moscow-City, the average rates for Class A are $650-750 per sq m/year, not including operating expenses and VAT and $500 for Class B. The rents in the Central Business District and Moscow-City are $750 - $1,200 and $700 - $1,100 respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Class A tenants are mostly IT and telecommunications companies, oil and gas (mostly due to TNK-BP large-scale lease in Nordstar BC), as well as pharmaceutical and medical companies.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The combination of the abovementioned factors makes the Leningradskiy submarket one of the most preferable for development. In the next few years about 0.5 million sq. m of new office space may be commissioned or 50% of the current supply. However even with the implementation of all planned projects the area will still be tempting for further development. In contrast to the CBD and Moscow-City, the district still offers plenty of areas for development, including the redevelopment of existing buildings.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research, CORE.XP comments the research findings:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The sheer number of major international and Russian companies that chose Leningrad business district as the location for their headquarters allows us to consider the Leningradskiy submarket a fully formed business district. However, unlike the CBD, the Leningradskiy submarket has great potential for further development, especially due to availability of sites for new construction and former industrial sites for redevelopment. In the current unstable macroeconomic situation where constraints on lease budgets are forcing tenants to focus on offices outside the Garden Ring in decentralized projects. Offices in the Leningradskiy submarket can be a decent alternative for less money without sacrificing quality and infrastructure, to which many are accustomed in the city centre.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Leningradskiy Business District is different from 7-10 years ago – the scale of reconstruction is huge and also it is necessary to highlight the importance of the work done. If earlier it was not definite, but it was strategically important direction from the point of investment into the projects, now developers want to construct there and the location is right for any company that is looking for effective operations and employees&amp;rsquo; comfort.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 5 February, 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, global real estate advisor, summarized 2013 year–end results. The key feature of the Moscow retail market in 2013 was decreasing consumer activity in the end of the year. Worsened expectations and existing credit activity constraints may lead consumers to switch to lower price segment goods.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;33 new brands opened their stores in Moscow in 2013. 24 new retail chains that entered Moscow market in 2013 opened their stores in shopping malls. This trend was taken mostly by fashion retailers. The majority of new international brands opened their stores in such shopping and entertainment centres as: Afimall City, Mega Belaya Dacha, and Atrium. According to CORE.XP, 60% of international chains that entered Moscow market were European by origin, 35% - from the USA, and 5% were the two Japanese brands: Marukame and Miki House. Several Russian chains had also introduced their first stores in Q4 2013. Fashion retailers Lexmer, Funday, and Bella Potemkina are among them. 17 international brands have already announced their plans to enter Moscow market by the end of 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Average vacancy rate in Moscow modern shopping malls in 2013 accounted to 2.6%, according to the latest data from CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;4 new quality shopping centres were delivered in Q4 2013. Two of them were the specialized ones (furniture centers). The total volume of commissioned retail space resulted in 262,000 sq m of new supply in 2013. Thereby by the end of year 2013 the total volume of quality retail space in Moscow shopping centers amounted to 4.1 mln. sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;900,000 sq m of quality retail space is announced to be delivered in 2014 year. But not all projects are expected to be commissioned in announced time period, and completions volumes may amount to 600,000 sq m. According to CORE.XP, new delivery of retail premises in 2014 may reach its maximum from 2009 and modern retail space penetration rate may reach the level of 430 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants that is close to the levels of Berlin and Vienna. The most anticipated 2014&amp;rsquo;s projects are SEC Avia Park, Vegas Crocus City, Vesna, Mozaika.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the street retail market there is a trend of low interest to this segment from fashion brands. During H2 2013 market share of the fashion sector declined from 18,5% to 16,9%, accessories - from 9,5% by 9%, respectively. On the contrary, public catering and banks are actively developing, and the share of such retailers increased during H2 2013, on average by 8%. The vacancy rate is 6,5% on average. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Pedestrian streets are not being used in full capacity yet. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The premises of less than 100 sq m are in great demand. They comprise nearly 40% of all market offerings.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rental rates in street retail are stable and have not significantly changed compared to Q3 2013 except for Novy Arbat, Petrovka, Pokrovka, and Pyatnitskaya where rental rates grew by the end of the year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Michael Rogozhin, Managing director of Retail Department, CORE.XP in Russia comments:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;In 2014 high developers’ activity may face weakening consumption. Russia enters into a stage of relatively low growth of real disposable income and retail sales. Retailers already felt weakening demand during Christmas / New Year sales period. Nonetheless, low growth is not a decline, and Moscow will still remain in retailers’ focus. 17 international brands already announced their plans to enter the market. Increase in competition combined with low growth in retail sales will stimulate landlords to make re-concepts of their properties.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 6 February, 2014 &amp;ndash; The key feature of the Moscow industrial and logistics market of the past 2 years remains high demand that continues to exceed the volume of new supply, according to the latest research from CORE.XP. The disproportion between these two indicators was quite high in 2012. Demand in 2012 exceeded the supply by 1,5 times (46%) that lead to the growth of the latter up to 930,000 sq m in 2013. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Over 2013 demand for logistics space in the Moscow region showed strong growth. The total volume of space, where deals were signed last year, exceeded the volume of annual construction by more than 21%. Over 2013 tenants and buyers signed lease and purchase agreements for a total of 1,12 mln sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A significant part of the delivery in 2013 was based on built-to-suit format. Share of BTS leasing agreement amounted to 31% compared to 36% a year earlier. But it should not be perceived as a new trend. An example of such a deal is Kimberly-Clark, hygienic and healthy goods production company, that leased 21,000 sq m in South Gate Industrial Park. The acquisition of the operating logistics premises by the end user has become the most uncommon deal of the year. Russian Post acquired operating facility of 55,000 sq m in Vnukovo Logistic.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Apart from that it is necessary to mention the other two major transactions of Q4 2013: Big Box lease in logistics park Noginsk by DIXY, retailer (40,000 sq m) and Yusen Logistics&amp;rsquo; lease of 24,000 sq m in Logopark Pokrov.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retail and logistic sectors took over 55% of warehouse space in the Moscow region in 2013. The deals were closed by players from these 2 business segments (FMCG and online retail included). 17% were leased by the production companies. Altogether 7 companies, industrial giants like Volvo, General Motors, Volkswagen, etc. acquired about 200,000 sq m of warehouse space. In 6 cases out of 7 the total area of deal exceeded 20,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2013 new supply reached 930,000 sq m. As a result, class A warehouse stock by the end of the year amounted to 7,2 mln sq m. On the one hand, this level reached its maximum in the past 6 years. On the other hand, the growth was around 13% of the total stock, which is a normal rate for an emerging market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Generally, in 2013 south direction was close to dominating in terms of developers’ activity. 39% of 2013’s new supply was delivered there. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Developers announced about 1,7 mln sq m of new warehouse space to be delivered in 2014. 35% (598,000 sq m) of this amount was already contracted.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Vacancy is still at the minimal level. It increased slightly compared to Q3 2013 up to 1.32%. To compare, at the end of 2009 it was approximately 16.9%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Commercial terms are stable over the past 2 years. Prime rents are $140/sq m/year (excluding VAT and operational expenses).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Specific rental rate depends on the geographic direction and distance from Moscow. Projects located within 10 km zone from MKAD and in the west and north-west directions benefit from the highest rental rates. East direction, where transport system is congested, witnesses the lowest average rents.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Operational expenses fluctuate within $35-45/sq m/year range, while average utility payments amounted to $8-12/sq m/year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Confirmed by the latest trends CORE.XP research reports that some increase in vacancy rate is possible. Though, it does not seem to have a systemic character. Estimated range for this indicator is 1-1,5%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;With stable prime rates at around $135-140/sq m/year, it is possible that in a lot of cases the actual signed rate will be different. This is expected to occur due to the increasing diversification of projects by direction, distance from MKAD, and sometimes quality of the delivered space.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse and Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia comments:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The significant share of prelease deals in annual take-up is lately the characteristic feature of the industrial and logistics market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2012 the amount of forward deals was about 50%, in 2013 this trend became stronger and by the end of 2013 67% of transactions were closed on prelease terms. It is expected that this trend will continue in 2014. 35% of the announced projects were already contracted. This is around 600,000 sq m. As a result, the existing trend will continue in 2014 with new delivery approaching to 1 mln sq m mark.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 7 February 2014 &amp;ndash; The European Industrial and Logistics real estate market attracted more than &amp;euro;14 billion worth of investment in 2013 - the highest single year since 2007 and representing an increase of over 50% on 2012, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Capital continues to flow into Industrial and Logistics real estate, with total investment volumes surpassing the full year total for each of the past four years by some distance. New sources of capital were attracted to the sector in 2013, with increased investment activity by specialist investor-developers; third party equity capital from Sovereign Wealth Funds in Asia and the Middle East; and overseas pension funds from North America. Growing private equity interest is also evident and expected to continue in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The core markets of the UK, Germany and France continue to dominate activity, accounting for nearly two thirds of last year&amp;rsquo;s activity in the sector. In terms of growth, however, there were particularly large percentage increases in the Southern European markets of Spain and Italy last year, while Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) also saw a sharp rise in activity. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The shift in investment appetite towards the Industrial and Logistics sector was a key trend of 2013, and no other sector saw such pronounced growth. A good deal of the growth occurred through partnership arrangements between specialist investor-developers and third party equity capital from Sovereign Wealth Funds and overseas pension funds. This testifies to the sector’s attraction to new sources of capital.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Growing private equity interest is also evident and expected to continue. There are some similarities here with trends in the US, where investment levels also rose last year and cap rates are on a downward path – one of the reasons for growing US interest in the European market. The trend is strong and set to continue in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The advantages of a high income return in a period of slow demand recovery and limited rental growth explain some of this, but it also reflects wider acceptance of the rationale for the sector for a range of investor types. With economic recovery gaining momentum and industrial production expected to improve further, occupational demand levels will see some cyclical growth to add further support to the investment case, and pricing in the better locations will continue to respond.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This scale of investment activity has produced significant and widespread pricing movements in prime yields for the best assets. In the final quarter of 2013, nearly half the industrial locations covered in CORE.XP’s quarterly yield survey moved lower. Taking the year as a whole, prime yields in some of the core European markets narrowed by 50 basis points or more, with London and Dublin among the largest movers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investments in Russian I&amp;amp;amp;L property in 2013 amounted to USD 1.3 bn., which is 3 times increase compared to the previous record. I&amp;amp;amp;L segment accounted for around 20% of the total investments in the Russian CRE. Observed high interest is fueled by both current high yield and its sustainability in the long run due to solid tenants’ demand for warehouse space. Combination of these factors generates market situation when quality properties for sale easily find buyers. In 2014 we expect to see strong demand in this segment with transaction amount depending only on owners readiness to market their quality properties for sale.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP the exclusive leasing and marketing agent of Arkada Shopping Centre in Ufa, Russia, reports that the construction of the shopping centre is almost completed. Arkada shopping centre will total 55,000 sq m. The grand opening of the shopping centre is planned for Q2 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Over 70% of the premises have been leased. Auchan Hypermarket commissioned its premises. The fit-out works have started there already. Other tenants have also received the information letters and are allowed to start fit-out works in March.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

The location of the shopping centre as well as the tenant mix - are the ticket to its success. The leader in its segment, the major food retailer, Auchan, shares our confidence in this project. Auchan opens the second hypermarket in the city in Arkada, as over 350,000 people live around the shopping centre.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 14 February 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP has revealed six key Industrial and Logistics (I&amp;amp;amp;L) trends to watch in 2014, with increased investment, consumer delivery demands from online retailing, supply chain efficiency, and the development of emerging markets all set to impact the sector.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;1.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;The Re-appearance of Rental Growth&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The re-appearance of rental growth will have a major impact on the I&amp;amp;amp;L sector in 2014. The recovery from 2013 is expected to continue with GDP and industrial production figures for the EU-28 forecasted to grow by 1.3% and 1.5% respectively. Growth is expected to emerge notably in the UK before moving to Germany, France and some parts of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;2.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Continued Investment Momentum&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investment focus shifted to the I&amp;amp;amp;L sector last year and continued momentum is expected in 2014. Partnership arrangements between specialist investor-developers and third party equity capital from Sovereign Wealth Funds and overseas pension funds underpinned a proportion of last year&amp;rsquo;s turnover growth and this is expected to continue.  Growing private equity interest is also evident.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This growth reflects wider acceptance of the investment rationale for the I&amp;amp;amp;L sector for a range of investor types, beyond the conventional justification of a higher income return in a period of recovery. Pricing in the better locations will respond to the increase in investment activity and occupier demand levels will see some cyclical growth, adding further support to the investment case.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;James Markby, Head of European Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Investment, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Investment in the I&amp;amp;amp;L was the strongest of any sector last year increasing by 50% with further expansion expected in 2014. The partnership arrangements between specialist investor-developers and third party equity capital from sovereign wealth and overseas pension funds is similar to the US, where investment levels rose last year and cap rates are on a downward path; therefore, creating US interest in the European market.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;3.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Innovation in Order Fulfilment and Delivery&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Growth in online retailing has underpinned over 40% of recent logistics leasing transactions in some markets and, with online retailing expected to post double-digit annual growth over the next five years, leasing transactions for e-tailing purposes will continue to increase.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Developing logistics systems to improve speed and reliability of delivery will address one of the main  barriers in online retailing – consumer concern with the delivery experience. We expect more competition in the sector that will create opportunities to expand parcel volumes or acquire specific or local capabilities. Further innovation in parcel delivery systems due to the need for reliable, cost-effective systems is also expected. This will require the evolution of denser networks of high-throughput urban logistics facilities close to major population centres.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;4.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Emerging Markets Grow&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Some of the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Africa are set to benefit from increased consumption by trading partners as a result of the economic recovery. Growth forecasts for these markets are some of the strongest in EMEA with the six largest markets in Africa expected to grow by 4.6%, eclipsing the 1.6% and 2.4% of Germany and the UK respectively. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Head of EMEA Industrial and Logistics Research, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Firms are increasingly choosing Africa as an expansion destination in their growth plans. Combined with transport infrastructure improvements, this will generate significant growth in the contract logistics market over the coming years”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;5.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;The Search for Supply Chain Efficiency Dominates&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the search for supply chain efficiency, occupiers, retailers and 3PLs are still implementing rigorous cost-management programmes. However, in order to offer a service that is sufficiently broad and efficient they need to balance cost-management with investment objectives across various categories of spending, and also devote as much flexibility to these decisions as possible. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;With improvements in connectivity between Western Europe and CEE, and the growth of industrial production and manufacturing, there will be greater outsourcing in 2014 to specialist logistics companies. The quest for efficiencies places a premium on highly-accessible facilities and high through-put urban sites. Centralisation of operations and inventory control are among the key advantages of XXL warehouses that saw significant growth in demand last year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“It is recognized by many occupiers and 3PLs that, in a relatively slow recovery, securing internal efficiencies will be a crucial way to build revenues and profitability.  “Pooling” strategies with several occupiers operating from the same facility, capital investment by occupiers themselves, and more sale and leasebacks as manufacturers look to release capital – all are likely features of the market in 2014. ”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;6.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;Resumption of Development&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Conditions are in place for a widespread resumption of development in 2014. Other than build-to-suit schemes, the I&amp;amp;amp;L development pipeline has been very thin for some time. Improvements in the market and significantly increased investor interest have encouraged developers to begin bringing schemes forward in a number of locations.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Unlike European counterparts, Russian Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics property market had been in the peak phase of the business cycle during the last few years. High new delivery (1 mln. sq m), share of XXL deals (30+%), strong interest of e-commerce players (10%+ of take up), solid yields (11-12%), and intensive development activity of the foreign investors – all these key trends of the European markets already exist in Russia. In 2014 Russian Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics property market is expected to remain strong despite some decrease in overall economic activity in the country.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
CORE.XP’s quarterly ranking of 97 prime retail locations/markets across the globe shows that competition in the world’s leading cities is getting even stronger. This demand is being fuelled by high-end retailers willing to pay record rents for the most coveted shops, while development levels are at historic lows resulting in a shortage of prime retail space.&#13;
&#13;
Hong Kong (US$4,334 per sq. ft. per annum) is the world’s most expensive location for prime retail rents by a substantial margin, followed by New York (US$3,300 per sq. ft. per annum), Paris (US$1,452 per sq. ft. per annum) and London (US$1,356 per sq. ft. per annum).&#13;
&#13;
Notably, average prime rents, as measured in local currency, posted double-digit increases in several key global markets during 2013, led by Paris, London and New York, which saw year-over-year growth of 29%, 18% and 11%, respectively, from levels that were already in the stratosphere.&#13;
&#13;
Raymond G. Torto, Global Chairman of Research, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&#13;
“There has been a lot of discussion about the strength of luxury retailers versus those that serve the mid-market. CORE.XP’s research provides further evidence that prime retail rents are strong in most markets and rose further in key global markets like New York, London and Tokyo. &#13;
“In many locations, prime retail rents have been buoyed by a shortage of available space in prime market areas and fervent demand from luxury brands. This lack of prime space has pushed some retailers toward secondary assets and markets. With construction levels at or near their troughs in many locations, this trend will likely continue in 2014.”&#13;
&#13;
Retailer demand in Hong Kong is focused on prime locations rather than secondary streets. The most sought-after prime streets are Russell Street in Causeway Bay, Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, and Queen’s Road Central in Central. These locations – which all recorded very tight vacancy – continue to attract both global and local retailers.&#13;
&#13;
New York’s Fifth Avenue continued its ascent into record territory during Q4 2013, with the luxury thoroughfare’s average asking rent rising 4.8% quarter-over-quarter to an all-time high of US$3,300 per sq. ft. per annum. For a 5,000-sq.-ft. space, that would translate to US$16.5 million per year in rent. Other prime luxury streets in the northeast U.S. also saw strong growth, including Newbury Street in Boston (up 6.7% quarter-over-quarter) and Walnut Street in Philadelphia (up 5.8% quarter-over-quarter) reporting the largest increases.&#13;
&#13;
The retail market in France was characterized by heavy polarisation, with substantial demand focused on prime space, especially in and around Paris. Significant interest from international retailers for the limited amount of available prime locations in Paris has resulted in steady rent growth over the past two years, with Paris’ average prime asking rent up 80% since Q1 2012. Sustained demand from international retailers will continue to support high street rents in 2014. &#13;
&#13;
Strong demand for prime retail pitches in London has pushed rents to record levels. The luxury sector is a huge driver of exponential rental and key money growth. The limited availability of space compared to demand for prime streets has led to increased demand for space on secondary pitches in central London. However, the UK market is heavily polarised with poorer secondary shopping centres and high streets suffering increasing levels of vacant space and falling rents.&#13;
&#13;
Competition for high street retail space in Sydney remains strong due to healthy demand from international retailers and limited availability. The bulk of new supply pipeline is attached to the Barangaroo office development; however, the first phase will not be completed until 2015. Australia is the only country with two cities featuring in the top ten highest retail rents with Melbourne ranked ninth. Melbourne became a hot landing spot for fast retailers during 2013, headlined by the first Australian stores of UNIQLO, H&amp;M and Forever 21.&#13;
&#13;
A recovery in the Japanese economy, a rebound in the stock market and anticipated growth in wages has translated into the highest consumer confidence since 2005. Big ticket items in department stores and luxury products both reported promising sales growth. Tokyo remains one of the key gateway cities for retailers that are new to Asia Pacific. With luxury brands seeking to expand and domestic retailers willing to try new locations, leasing activity has spread to peripheral areas such as the Jinnan area in Shibuya.&#13;
&#13;
Rental growth in Moscow high streets has remained stable throughout 2013. Demand for space remains steady, but the structure of the retail market is changing. The ratio of fashion retailers in high streets continues to decrease as the majority of Muscovites prefer purchasing clothes and footwear in shopping malls. Moscow is also set to see a significant number of new large scale shopping malls being delivered to the market.&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &#13;
&#13;
“The majority of new international entrants to the Moscow market are positioned in segments other than luxury. They prefer to open flagship stores mainly in the landmark shopping malls due to a number for reasons. Inability to secure convenient commercial conditions and some problems with customers’ traffic are among them. The only exceptions include luxury brands Cartier, Patek Philippe, and RED Valentino. Current demand is not sufficient to fuel rental rates growth in Moscow high street.”&#13;
&#13;
Global retailers continue to seek prime retail space in Beijing with designer brands 3.1 Phillip Lim and Cheap Monday opening their first China standalone stores. Fast fashion brands are seeking opportunities in core submarkets, while food and beverage operators are increasingly popular with shopping mall landlords, especially those in secondary locations due to their ability to attract footfall.</value></field><field name="DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE"><value>text</value></field><field name="CODE"><value>hongkong_ret</value></field><field name="TAGS"/><field name="XML_ID"><value>988</value></field><field name="IBLOCK_SECTION"/><property name="P_DIR"><value>412</value></property><property name="P_COUNTRY"><value>419</value><value>418</value></property><property name="P_FILE"/></item><item><field name="ACTIVE"><value>Y</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_FROM"><value>05.03.2014 15:44:00</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_TO"/><field name="SORT"><value>500</value></field><field name="NAME"><value>European Retail Investment in 2013 at Highest Level Since 2007</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_PICTURE"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT"><value>Investment Jumps to €15.5bn in Q4 2013; Highest Quarterly Total Since Q4 2006

North American, Asian and Middle Eastern Capital Increasingly Active
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>text</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 5 March 2014 &amp;ndash; European retail investment jumped to &amp;euro;15.5 billion in Q4 2013 - the highest quarterly total since Q4 2006 and almost double the Q3 2013 total, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investors continue to move up the risk spectrum in the face of improved economic sentiment in Europe.  Overall, 2013 was by far the strongest year for retail investment in Europe since 2007 with €41.3 billion transacted, compared to €34.3 billion in 2012 - a 20.4% increase. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retail investment activity continues to broaden both geographically and in terms of asset quality. Q4 2013 saw a pronounced revival in Southern Europe, Ireland and also a growing number of deals in fringe Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) markets. The diversity of investors is also growing with North American, Asian and Middle Eastern capital active across a wide range of retail segments and markets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;John Welham, Head of EMEA Retail Investment, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Early autumn 2013 saw the first major wave of investors looking beyond core-assets in major markets and toward non-core opportunities. This trend accelerated in the last quarter, exceeding expectations in many markets, including those most affected by the eurozone crisis such as Spain, Italy and Ireland.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The most significant push factors behind this trend continue to be relative pricing, with investors increasingly looking for better yields, and constrained product availability at the core end of the market.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The economic growth story is clearly benefiting the UK, making it one of the few mature markets to see a significant increase in retail investment in 2013. Investor interest is broadly based and spread well beyond core assets and markets, significantly boosting liquidity within retail warehouse and supermarket segments.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Iberia recorded the strongest improvement in retail investment in 2013, with a 129% increase year-on-year. This revival was led by the Spanish market that was influenced by a small number of large transactions by international buyers. The Spanish retail investment market was dominated by North American investors in 2013 with €1.3 billion of investment out of the €2 billion total.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Italy also saw significant retail investment activity in 2013 at €2.2 billion. International capital dominated the market, accounting for 87% of the total, with North American buyers contributing the largest share.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The diversity of the investors active - both in terms of type and nationality - is another notable trend of 2013 and of H2 2013 in particular. Cross-border investment grew from 36% of the total in H1 2013 to 46% in the second half of the year. It is cross-border investors who tend to feature on the buy-side of the majority of large retail transactions in almost every market. 2013 was also the first year to record a higher level of cross-regional investment than of intra-European cross-border buyers, with €8.8 billion and €7.7 billion respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Iryna Pylypchuk, EMEA Research and Consulting, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“North American, Asian and Middle Eastern capital is increasingly active across a wide range of retail segments and markets. They are already a driving force in Southern European markets. Spanish retail, for example, recorded the highest influx of North American capital in history in 2013 with €1.3 billion invested - up on the previous record of €1.2 billion back in 2009. Back then it was driven by a small number of particularly large transactions, but current activity is more broadly based and should be seen as a trend.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Among all cross-regional investors, North American buyers are the most active outside the core retail segments, particularly in the UK, contributing to a notable increase in last year investment activity This is expected to continue into the near term, but broadening across more markets, with Germany and France set to be the next main beneficiaries.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Increase in investment volumes in Europe reflects growing optimism, fueled by positive macroeconomic statistics from Eurozone. As a result, investors are ready to consider opportunities in secondary assets and even in peripheral countries. Russia is a bit different story. In 2014 we might see a combination of decreased growth rate in retail sales and strong new delivery of retail schemes. In this situation investors tend to be more conservative, focusing on the core assets. There is quite a low probability that this trend will change in the nearest couple of quarters.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A strong finish to 2013 took total commercial real estate investment volume in Europe to &amp;euro;165.6 billion, an increase of 30% on the previous year’s total. The Q4 2013 total of nearly €61 billion was the highest quarterly figure recorded in Europe since Q4 2007. The final quarter of the year normally sees the highest level of investment, but the activity seen represents significant acceleration in the rate of growth.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London captured over 23% of the total European market* with €32.2 billion worth of transactions in 2013. This is the second consecutive year of strong growth in investment activity with year-on-year increases of 45% (2011 to 2012) and 43% (2012 to 2013). On a quarterly basis, investment in London increased every quarter last year with Q4 2013 up 73% on Q3 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Simon Barrowcliff, Executive Director, Central London Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;London had a phenomenal year with the total value of investment reaching pre-global financial crisis levels. Looking forward to 2014, it is unlikely that the market will repeat this performance. Although cross-border investor demand, particularly from Asia, remains strong. The supply of product may well prove the limiting factor.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Beyond London there remains scope for further growth in investment turnover in 2014. The UK had a remarkable year in 2013, particularly the last four or five months, when investment activity jumped sharply. The rest of the UK saw a staggering 75% year-on-year increase in the total value of activity as investors searched for yield and the general appetite for risk rose. The improving UK economy is enhancing the prospects for commercial real estate in the rest of the UK and encouraging even cross-regional investors to venture outside London.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Germany continues to perform well with five cities featuring in CORE.XP’s top ten of European investment markets. Last year investment in Germany as a whole had a strong domestic component. Despite improvements in other European economies, German investors continue to be strongly focused on their home market. Each of the five saw local investors take more than a 50% share and in Hamburg nearly 85% of capital invested in 2013 came from local buyers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Paris again occupies the second place, with over €11 billion of commercial real estate investment activity. However, by comparison with other top cities 2013 was a flat year for the Paris market with total investment falling by 8% year-on-year compared to significant increases in most of the other top ten markets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow has been a regular at the top of the list of most liquid markets in Europe for the last four years. Next to London it had the highest proportion of cross-border capital in 2013. Moscow attracts a significant amount of investment from North America helped by the fact that for the best quality property, rents are generally denominated in US dollars.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research Department&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Moscow’s 4th place in the rating is a clear evidence of opportunities, available for investors in Russian commercial real estate. With additional €260 million  Moscow could enter even top-3 of the most attractive European cities for the investments into commercial real estate. Available opportunities offer rather high yields, while Russian government efforts to improve investment climate would contribute to the decrease of risk premiums. This process moves relatively slowly yet, but authorities seem to be goal-oriented on this road.  Decrease in economic activity growth rates might cool down investors in 2014. However, this factor can also create new opportunities for the long term players.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While 2013 was a strong year for Europe’s commercial real estate investment market as a whole, the recovering markets of Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Spain saw a dramatic resurgence. A greater appetite for risk from investors led to a sharp increase in investment activity. In 2013, total investment in these markets was more than double that in 2012, reaching €11.8 billion and marking the first year of growth in investment turnover since 2007.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“2013 was a turning point in a number of different ways for Europe’s commercial real estate investment market. Consequently, we expect 2014 to be a year in which those trends are consolidated, rather than a year of further revolution. Last year’s biggest change by far was the resurgence in investment in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Having doubled year-on-year in 2013, aggregate annual turnover in these four markets has already reached the level that was being seen in 2004/05. As a result, Madrid will more than likely be in the top ten European investment destinations in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Another trend that we expect to accelerate in 2014 is the flow of Chinese capital into Europe. This has been expected for some time, but increased dramatically in 2013 with €2.4 billion in acquisitions over the year (twice as much as in the previous ten years combined).

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 11 March 2014 &amp;ndash; Office activity within the European legal sector is on the up as an increasing number of firms return to the market with relocation requirements prompted by improving macro-economic data and sentiment across the region.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s latest research, London and Frankfurt in particular saw demand pick up strongly in 2013 with combined take up of 56,000 sq m in the third quarter, the highest since Q1 2010. While increased activity is not yet evident across all regional locations, law firms in a number of markets have taken the opportunity in recent quarters to secure high quality and optimally located premises. For example, prime office buildings such as White Gardens in Moscow and Cannon Place in London have been leased and pre-lets at new development schemes including Beethovenstraat 400 in Amsterdam and the TanusTurm in Frankfurt have been signed. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Zachary Gauge, EMEA Research and Consulting at CORE.XP, explains this trend:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The legal sector, like other service-led professions, has been affected by the economic downturn meaning cost consideration has played a pivotal role in real estate planning in recent years. Typically, firms have taken advantage of the difficult market conditions facing their landlords to renegotiate their existing leases on improved financial terms. However, as the economy shows distinct signs of improvement, law firms which are often structured as partnerships, have demonstrated that they are well positioned to quickly react to changing market sentiment to secure new leases for efficient, centrally located prime office space. As 2014 progresses, we expect leasing activity to increase further and see examples of office relocations spread across an even broader range of European markets, as business confidence returns.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;For those firms who choose to move to new prime office locations, recent transactions have highlighted that the legal sector is prepared to pay amongst the highest rents in the market to secure optimal space. This does not reflect a loosening of cost control policy, instead the financial justification is realised by the associated floor space reduction which is a typical knock-on-effect of securing such modern space. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In terms of workspace strategy, the majority of legal firms continue to operate within a cellular layout, however, some are taking relocation as an opportunity to reconfigure the space to fit more into less. There are now examples, particularly in London and Amsterdam, of such firms introducing open plan working into their office environments.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mr. Gauge, continues:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“While most firms are sticking to a cellular layout, we are seeing increased numbers enquire about modern workplace strategies, suggesting that the legal sector is starting to consider alternatives to the traditional cellular layout, which can have both social and economic benefits. It will be interesting to see if the legal industry is prepared to embrace more radical changes to working environments as seen in other corporate sectors going forward.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Since the onset of the economic downturn, the legal profession in Europe has undergone significant structural changes to its business model which has impacted on real estate strategy and resulted in a clear distinction between rental levels paid by international and domestic firms. This helps explain why despite 50% of legal firms agreeing a rent within 10% or above prime market value since 2012, across most prime markets rents remain some way below pre-recessionary levels. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Marc Reboux, Senior Director, EMEA, Office Agency &amp;amp;amp; Tenant Representation at CORE.XP, comments: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The last decade has seen a fundamental shift in the legal sector. Corporates now look for legal advice from multiple suppliers as opposed to the traditional two pronged approach of either seeking advice in-house or hiring a full service single law firm to look after legal needs. The main driver of this switch is cost and it has meant the legal sector has needed to have a more competitive pricing model to secure clients.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“With this in mind, legal firms have placed more focus on real estate costs which is the second largest cost behind labour in the sector. This means legal firms, particularly domestic players, are more inclined to negotiate below peak market rental value, which represents an opportunity for occupiers who are prepared to take a long term view of the market to secure deals on favourable terms.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Lidia Alexandrova, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/tenant_representation/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Global Corporate Services&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Department in CORE.XP, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Legal sector in Moscow is stable. There is no neither increase nor decrease in volumes of office space occupied by legal firms. The total is the same as it was last year. There is quite a big interest to the White Gardens business-centre as a key project in central business district that was commissioned last year. Dentons and Baker McKinsey has moved there (the deal was announced in 2012). Other legal companies continue to look at this option for their office. At the same time as new delivery in CBD is limited (only two projects are announced for delivery in 2014 and one project for 2015), many companies prefer to keep their current office location in quality Class A buildings.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 12 March – The convenience of online shopping and speedy delivery is becoming increasingly important to Christmas shoppers, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;With guaranteed fast delivery, online price comparisons and sales beginning before Christmas, online retail impacted on overall sales and outstripped normal sales significantly and is thought to be the &amp;ldquo;convenient&amp;rdquo; option for consumers as they increase their normal levels of shopping. Despite an improving economy, consumers continue to maintain an element of caution for non-discretionary items.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Of the retailers that separate online and store transactions, the majority of growth over the festive season came from online sales. This was also true at national level and was most evident in Germany where free returns for online purchased became commonplace for the first time.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Total Retail Sales vs. Online Sales (including Multichannel)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/d29/Retail Sales vs Online Sales.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Retail Sales vs Online Sales.png&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Retail Sales vs Online Sales.png&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;311&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;305&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite consumers increasingly turning to the &amp;lsquo;convenience&amp;rsquo; of online shopping over the festive period, physical stores remain important. The ‘Click and Collect’ service that many retailers provide has become central to retailers’ multichannel strategies and is increasingly considered the most ‘convenient’ option by consumers. This is evident with French brand FNAC having grown their ‘Click and Collect’ sales by 10% since 2012. Over the Christmas period in 2013, 30% of online sales for the FNAC brand were collected in-store.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A number of high-profile multichannel retailers have announced plans to significantly extend their store portfolios. John Lewis is planning 25 new stores, including one international outlet by 2023. H&amp;amp;amp;M is planning to open 375 stores globally in 2014 and Desigual wants 300 stores by 2018, including 20 in Germany this year. This reflects the results of CORE.XP’s 2013 survey – ‘The Physical Store in the Digital World’ - that revealed 87% of retailers want the same or more stores in the future.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;By region, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), the UK, and Ireland had the most successful Christmas. UK figures grew 5.3% on December 2012 (although sales fell back slightly in January, they were still 4.3% ahead of the same period last year), while Ireland showed a 3.7% increase on December 2012. The warmer weather resulted in disappointing sales in the Nordics, while Southern European markets showed slightly reduced figures from the same period in 2012.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Overall sales volumes over Christmas were flat throughout the European Union (EU-28) rising just 0.1% in December year-on-year and declining 1% in the eurozone area. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Neville Moss, Head of EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In spite of an improvement in consumer sentiment, shoppers remain cautious. Bargain hunting, comparing prices online and waiting for the last minute before buying presents in the expectation that retailers will discount prices prior to Christmas day were all features of the festive season. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Following the same trend of the last few years, high quality multichannel retailers with a strong brand presence experienced the best of the festive period. While the Christmas period was disappointing overall for retailers, evidence is pointing to a distinct improvement in the spring and this is set for continuation throughout 2014, especially if there is a return to real wage growth.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Christmas shopping activity in Moscow was quite low, following pan-European trends. Decreased consumer confidence adversely influenced sales in many segments. Both offline and online retailers suffered from this trend. Jewelry, kids’ goods and electronic gadgets retailers were the most successful. In addition, retailers confirmed trend on the development of the multichannel sales.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Cannes - Moscow, 13 March 2014 &amp;ndash; The number of investors viewing Spain as the most attractive market for commercial real estate acquisitions has increased dramatically as investors move up the risk curve in 2014, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The much stronger tone and sentiment in the European commercial real estate investment market is clearly reflected in the findings of CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s 2014 &amp;lsquo;European Real Estate Investor Intentions’ survey.  Investor confidence in Western Europe is up sharply compared with last year, with the market chosen by 71% of respondents as the most attractive global region for investment.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;There are significant shifts in geographical preferences, with a strong rise in the proportion (19%) of investors seeing Spain as most attractive for purchases in 2014 – up from 6% from 2013. Madrid is now in second place to London as the most attractive city for investment, a dramatic change from last year, with Barcelona also in this year’s top ten choices. Investor appetite for opportunities in ‘recovery markets’ is further evidenced by the inclusion of Amsterdam and Dublin among the top ten. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Peter Damesick, Chairman, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The sharp increase in investor interest in Spain follows a strong proportionate rise in turnover in the Spanish investment market over the course of the past year, with sales totalling &amp;euro;5 billion in 2013 overall - more than double the level in 2012.  Resurgent investment demand in Spain reflects the easing of concerns surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and positive investor perceptions of recovery potential in the Spanish market with recently improving economic indicators.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The UK regains its position in 2014 as the single most attractive country for making purchases, selected by 29% of investors. The UK economic recovery has gathered pace over the past year and is outpacing the eurozone. Germany is in second place with 21% of the vote, down from 35% in the 2013 survey when it was first choice. Also noteworthy, although much less dramatic, are the increased proportions of investors identifying the Netherlands and Italy as most attractive. Both these markets saw increased investment activity over the past year as investors took a more confident view of their relative value and recovery prospects. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investors are clearly moving up the risk curve in 2014, with almost half of investors reporting increased appetite for secondary property. A clear majority (65%) view the most attractive types of assets outside the prime/core space - a higher proportion than last year (58%). A large majority (67%) of investors also expect their purchasing activity to be higher this year than in 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While there is still substantial demand for prime or core real estate assets, the proportion of investors saying these were their most preferred asset type decreased from 42% in 2013 to 35% this year. Those investors viewing ‘good secondary’ as most attractive increased to 33% from 25% last year.  There is also an increase in the attractiveness of ‘opportunistic/value-add’ assets from 25% to 28% &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In a clear reflection of the gathering strength of investment demand and capital commitments directed at European commercial real estate, investors identified the availability of stock as the single biggest obstacle to acquisitions, followed by asset pricing, and competition from other investors. These obstacles to investment are symptomatic of more crowded and keenly priced markets and are consistent with the survey evidence of investors showing greater risk appetite and viewing assets outside the prime/core space as most attractive. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;It is noteworthy that only 7% of respondents cited the cost or availability of debt as the greatest obstacle to investment in 2013. This is a significant change from the past two years when the ability to source debt was a more potent constraint on activity. This finding is reinforced by other recent CORE.XP research that has shown an increasing number of lenders becoming active in European markets and significant relaxation in lending terms over the past twelve months; both in terms of lending margins and available loan to value ratios.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“What a difference a year makes. Investment activity in European commercial real estate markets gathered pace rapidly over the second half of 2013 and maintained strong momentum at the start of 2014. Against the backdrop of improving economic conditions and the abatement of the euro crisis, the overall picture that emerges is of a rapidly warming real estate investment market fuelled by a strengthening flow of capital and increased risk appetite.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The gathering tempo of investment demand has itself brought fresh challenges and concerns for investors. Investors are finding markets to be more crowded, competitive and keenly priced; all of which is pushing some investors to target a wide range of locations and asset types beyond prime.“&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investment activity in Europe grows quickly, following general economic recovery. Investors are ready to take higher risks, considering second tier properties and opportunities in the peripheral European countries, which significantly suffered from the recent economic crisis. After 20+% growth in 2013, we might see another double digit increase in investment volumes in 2014. After peak investment activity in 2013, Russia faces significantly increased non-economic risks. These risks will cool down investors’ activity, at least, in H1 2014.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 14 March 2014 &amp;ndash; Returning occupier confidence and improving office take-up will drive rental growth across EMEA in 2014, according to new research by CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s analysis shows that aggregate office take-up across Europe increased by 9.6% in Q4 of 2013, as improving economic sentiment in a number of European markets alleviated occupier caution. Take-up in Central London totaled 365,000 sq m in Q4, representing a 9% increase quarter-on-quarter, capping a 39% rise year-on-year. The increase in leasing activity led the City of London market to experience its first rental growth since 2010, with prime rents increasing by 4.5% in Q4. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;There was also a marked improvement in Dublin and Madrid, two of the markets most severely affected by the Eurozone debt crisis. In Dublin, take-up increased by 47% in Q4, and 24% year-on-year, buoyed in large part by demand from the Technology, Media and Telecommunications sector. As a result, prime office rents in Dublin increased significantly, with a 17% rise recorded in Q4, and 27% over the course of 2013. In Madrid, a strong recovery in demand is evident, with take-up in Q4 more than double that in Q3, and take-up in 2013 120% greater than that recorded in 2012. In CEE, Warsaw recorded its highest ever annual take-up at 457,000 sq m with demand focused on the city centre and surrounding areas, while Moscow saw annual take-up increase by 4% on 2012.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While CORE.XP forecasts a recovery across EMEA’s key office markets, the variable pace of economic recovery means growth in prime rents and take-up will be uneven. CORE.XP reports that over the course of 2013 prime rents in a number of markets reached a trough from which they will increase in 2014. These include Milan and Madrid, where take-up in both markets exceeded 100,000 sq m in Q4, one of the highest levels recorded in recent years. A buoyant manufacturing and energy sector in Milan accounted for 32% of such take-up in Q4, in line with the volume recorded over the full year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Meanwhile, a handful of office markets remain subdued as a result of ongoing economic uncertainty. For example, take-up in Paris declined 16% in Q4 quarter on quarter, leaving annual take-up in the city at the lowest level for ten years, yet rents have remained relatively stable declining less than 4% over that period. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Head of EMEA Research, CORE.XP, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The overall picture is a positive one, with the economic uncertainty that constrained occupiers for the past two years beginning to dissipate evidenced by increased corporate confidence to  lease and acquire space. This has resulted in increased take-up levels putting upward pressure on rents in a number of markets. While we expect more widespread rental growth across EMEA in 2014, the recovery will be uneven. Some markets are just entering the recovery phase, while others – including Central London - are experiencing rapid growth with others edging towards plateau.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mark Caskey, Head of Global Corporate Services, EMEA said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The improving economic outlook has significant implications for corporate occupiers. On the one hand it means that corporates can begin to implement expansion plans that have largely been on hold over the past few years, but equally, for those with a large footprint across EMEA rising rental values increases the need to manage costs. Many occupiers have &amp;lsquo;locked in’ rents at the bottom of the cycle and we would expect many more to do the same over the course of this year.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Director, Head of Office Agency in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Growing take-up in European office markets is another evidence of steady recovery of the Eurozone economy after world economic crisis. In Russia rental rates are expected to remain under downward pressure from decreasing rates of growth in economic indicators and relatively large new delivery of 2014’s. In this situation we might see demand shifting to cheaper quality office renting opportunities and more flexible landlords’ strategies when discussing commercial terms.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 25 March 2014 &amp;ndash; The mood at MIPIM 2014 was overwhelmingly positive with 85% of property professionals declaring that they are feeling &amp;lsquo;bullish&amp;rsquo; about the European commercial real estate market, according to a recent opinion poll by global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP surveyed more than 300 property professionals at MIPIM 2014 - the world's biggest property forum held in Cannes - to discover current sentiment in the European commercial real estate market. The survey reveals that of the respondents polled the majority are feeling ‘bullish’ about the European commercial real estate market in 2014. This sentiment compares favourably with 2013, with more than three quarters (77%) describing their current mood as either ‘more positive’ or ‘about the same’ as last year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The CORE.XP survey revealed that the much stronger tone and sentiment in the European commercial real estate investment market is returning to the levels seen in 2007 before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). More than half (53%) of respondents stated that they were either ‘more positive’ or felt ‘about the same’ as in 2007. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The feeling of positivity was palpable at MIPIM 2014; there is certainly less caution and more confidence. During the first half of 2013, investors were focused on core markets and assets, and the big change we have seen coming into 2014 is that investors are now looking for growth. We have moved away from crisis and investors are beginning to feel much more positive about the eurozone. Where we had a significant divide between the north and south of Europe, we are now seeing recovery and growth.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Respondents were also asked what types of property assets (by sector and market type) were most attractive to purchase in 2014. The spread of answers was varied with a significant majority stating a preference for Offices (40%), followed by Retail (32%) and Industrial (28%) assets. While it is clear that there is still substantial demand for core markets such as the UK, Germany and France (40%), those viewing ‘recovering’ (34%) and ‘emerging’ (26%) as most attractive reflects increased confidence among investors and a desire to move up the risk curve in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/524/Market Type and Sector  MIPIM.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Market Type and Sector  MIPIM.jpg&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Market Type and Sector  MIPIM.jpg&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;409&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The positivity at MIPIM among property professionals is supported in the findings of CORE.XP’s ‘European Real Estate Investor Intentions 2014’ survey. The report revealed that investor confidence in Western Europe is up sharply compared with last year, with the market chosen by 71% as the most attractive global region for investment.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This report revealed significant shifts in geographical preferences, with a strong rise in the proportion (19%) of investors seeing Spain as most attractive for purchases in 2014 – up from 6% from 2013. Madrid is now in second place to London as the most attractive city for investment, a dramatic change from last year, with Barcelona also in this year’s top ten choices. Investor appetite for opportunities in ‘recovery markets’ is further evidenced by the inclusion of Amsterdam and Dublin among the top ten. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The report also revealed that Offices were the most attractive sector in 2014, recording a notably higher share of the vote (39%) than in 2013 (29%).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“MIPIM delegates  confirmed trends, which had already been seen in statistics for more than half a year. Commercial real estate markets are going up combined with investors’ readiness to accept higher risks. In 2014 this factor was expected to become one of the strong drivers for Russian commercial real estate market. However, the recent geopolitical events calmed down investors’ activity, forcing them to wait for more certainty regarding future development scenario. Nonetheless, unless GDP growth will have decreased below 1% mark, we might expect that in 2014 Moscow will remain one of the most active markets, though, mainly due to the national investors.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;More than 300 MIPIM attendees, spread across a range of commercial real estate professionals, were surveyed from Tuesday, March 11 to Friday, March 14. Respondents were asked for the views on the current commercial real estate investment market in relation to MIPIM 2013 and pre-Global Financial Crisis in 2007. Respondents were also asked their preferred asset sector and type for investment in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As of the end of 2013 Moscow is  the sixth city in the world in terms of rental rates in high-quality office space with premium location.

The developer of the retail parks is Norman Asset Management. The parks will be located in Zhukovskiy and Elektrostal.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Both projects will represent the new concept of retail park with a total area of 55,000 sq m that include a hypermarket,  Do-it-Yourself hypermarket as well as retail gallery.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retail park in Zhukovskiy will be opened in Q2 2015. The grand opening of N1 in Elektrostal is planned for Q3 2015.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP has successfully realized the first park from the N1 Retail park chain in Tver (former Oktyabrskiy shopping centre). It was fully leased one month before its grand opening that is planned for 12 April 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The development activity of shopping centre space around the world is focused in China. Indeed, more than half of the shopping centre space under construction in the 180 countries surveyed is taking place within China’s borders. Shanghai takes first position with 3.3 million sq m of space under construction – more than the combined total of all 86 European cities excluding those in Russia and Turkey. Just behind Shanghai is Chengdu with 3.2 million sq m followed by Shenzhen and Tianjin with 2.7 million sq m and 2.5 million sq m under construction respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Other markets in the top ten include Istanbul, Wuhan, Moscow, Beijing, Nanjing, and Guangzhou.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Southeast Asia, nearly 40% of the 3.3 million sq m under construction is located in Kuala Lumpur, making it the 12th most active market globally. In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi have also seen a large number of new developments in suburban areas and are seeing strong leasing demand from retailers attracted by lower rents and the lower-to-mid income residences nearby.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Buoyant occupier demand is pushing a strong development pipeline in New Delhi with 500,000 sq m of new retail space currently under construction.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Middle East, Abu Dhabi continues to strengthen its position as a leading retail destination with three centres (168,000 sq m) completed in 2013 and another eight centres (778,000 sq m) currently under construction.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Europe, Russian and Turkish cities continue to dominate the development pipeline. The most active market in Europe is Istanbul with 27 centres (1.9 million sq m) currently under construction. As in other markets, much of this new space is away from the city centre in peripheral locations.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow leads the development for Russia with 1.5 million sq m of space due to open over the next three years. However, development activity is also at an all-time high in regional cities, such as St Petersburg, Yekateringburg, Samara, and Novosibirsk, with some 2.6 million sq m due for completion in 2014 alone.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Natasha Patel, EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Global development activity is similar to last year in terms of location with new construction dominated by Asia and in particular China. The scale of new development there is due not only to economic growth in the region, but also due to the demands of cross-border retailers, many of whom have found that the existing retail space in the region is not of the standard they require.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Of the 35 new centre openings in Europe in 2013, 26 were in Eastern Europe, with only four in Central Europe and just five in Western Europe. Although new shopping centre development remains at historically low levels in much of Western Europe, many larger centres have extensions planned to accommodate the strong occupier demand for the best retail destinations around Europe. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research Department&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“New retail properties delivery volumes in Moscow and in the Russian regions in 2014 have good chances to approach or even beat the historical records. Unfortunately, the peak in developers’ activity might face weak demand as a result of weakening Russian macroeconomic indicators, being adversely influenced by geopolitical events. Increased uncertainty puts constraints on chain retailers’ development plans. Higher volatility of financial markets makes it more difficult to arrange proper project financing. As a result, there are growing risks of frozen projects and postponements in their turns into operations. Nonetheless, the chance for positive scenario in H2 still remains in place.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Lack of Product Constrains Investment in Central London in Q1 2014&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 22 April 2014 - Improved investor confidence and lending conditions, as well as notably increased activity from opportunistic investors in recovering markets, led to a strong start for the European commercial real estate market in 2014, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Total commercial real estate investment in Europe reached &amp;euro;37.9 billion in Q1 2014 - a 18% increase on Q1 2013. Following an exceptionally strong end to 2013, the Q1 2014 total was predictably below Q4 2013&amp;rsquo;s €62.4billion.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The fastest year-on-year growth in Q1 2014 was seen in Austria (+183%), Ireland (+179%), Spain (+132%) and Finland (+103%). The core markets of Sweden (+68%), Germany (+47%) and France (+37%) also showed significant growth compared to Q1 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;A broad range of investors are active in Europe at the moment, with the strongest activity in the value-add end of the market. Lending conditions are improving across Europe, starting with Western Europe, and this means more access to debt and more opportunity for investors to borrow against non-core product.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Opportunistic investors, particularly from the US, are targeting markets such as Spain and Ireland on the back of economic recovery and to take advantage of potential future yield compression. North American investors accounted for almost half of Spain’s total commercial real estate investment in 2013, while last year was the first time that we have seen significant activity by Americans in the Irish real estate market. This trend has continued into 2014, with Spain also seeing significant acquisitions by buyers from China and the Middle East.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“At the same time, there continues to be strong demand for core investment product in the CBD markets of Paris, Stockholm and the major German cities. There has already been considerably more international investment in the German market than has been the case in recent years, with UK and US investors buying large portfolios. Investors are also seeking value-add assets in secondary locations in Germany.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investment activity in the UK held relatively steady compared with Q1 2013, slipping 3% to €11.4 billion. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Simon Barrowcliff, Executive Director, Central London Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“London recorded its highest-ever quarterly investment total in Q4 2013, surpassing even the peak levels of 2007, so there has been a not unexpected drop in turnover in Q1 2014 due entirely to lack of available investments. Investors were, however, more active in the UK’s regions this quarter, as they seek out opportunities in the face of an increasing lack of investment product in the country’s capital. There are perhaps five or six major regional UK cities being targeted by investors, with Manchester and Edinburgh leading the pack.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Commercial real estate investment activity in Central &amp;amp;amp; Eastern Europe (CEE) dropped 35% on the same quarter last year, driven by a significant decrease in Russia, which recorded its lowest quarter since Q1 2012. Poland (+41%) showed significant growth compared to Q1 2013. Some of the smaller markets also saw decreased levels of investment; however, Romania saw significant uplift (albeit from a low base). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mike Atwell, Head of Capital Markets CEE, CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The appetite for investment in CEE continues and although Q1 2014 volumes in some countries may depict a slowdown, the year is likely to be up overall. Poland showed a sharp increase over Q1 2013, predominantly due to the Rondo 1 and Poznan City Center deals. We are also involved in numerous other transactions, both in Warsaw and regionally, and so forecast a good y-o-y increase.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The drop in y-o-y activity in Russia coincides with increasing tensions in Ukraine; however, this is not the driver of the slowdown primarily - Q1 2013 was extremely active and driven by a small amount of large transactions. Russian investor appetite is expected to keep volumes high during 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In countries such as Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania we are seeing increased activity and new interest from investors who are looking more favourably on these markets than previously was the case. While we have not seen that interest converting into closed deals yet, we expect this to change through 2014 and volumes should again be up on 2013.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investment activity in Europe continues growing. Investors target more risky assets and geographies. Wider spread of these strategies is explained not only by expectations of further recovery in Eurozone economy, but also by softening lending  conditions, increasing loans availability for transactions with second tier assets and geographies. Decrease of investment volumes in Russian CRE by 77%, in fact, is pretty artificial, as in Q1 2013 we witnessed a few closures of large transactions, which were started in 2012.  In reality, Q1 2014 investment volumes in the Russian CRE market were high and not typical for usually “low season” of Q1.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 29 April, 2014 - According to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s latest office market report, despite negative geopolitical situation, the Moscow market was stable in Q1 2014 with the exception of some decrease in Class A Prime. Some owners of Class A office buildings in the CBD have already lowered lease rates by 10-15%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Significant events for the city’s office market in Q1 2014 included: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Three Class A office buildings totalling 130,000 sq m &amp;ndash; Eurasia Tower, Mebe One Khimki Plaza and Krasnaya Roza Morozov Phase II – were put into operation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Due to Eurasia Tower commissioning, the majority of new delivery has been in the zone between the Garden Ring (GR) and the Third Transportation Ring (TTR)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regardless of Russian Ruble devaluation and unstable geopolitical situation, done deals volume remained stable with only 7% decrease compared to Q4 2013 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The zone between the TTR and MKAD remains leading in terms of take-up volume (48% of the total) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;61% of closed deals were done in Class B buildings, in Class A – 39% (14% of which account for two large-scale deals of PepsiCo (13,000 sq m) and Systematica (17,000 sq m))&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The majority of deals were signed by Russian companies, 84% of the total &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The most popular office size demanded was blocks up to 1,000 sq m, 81% of the total number of deals&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The overall vacancy rate increased (from 12% in Q4 2013 to 13% in Q1)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy in Class B properties remained stable (10.8%)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy in Class A properties increased (from 17% in Q4 2013 to 20.6% in Q1)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy in Moscow-City increased to 37%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stable rents&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 2014 the total Moscow office market take-up was 214,000 sq m which is comparable to the volume of deals closed in Q1 2011 (219,000 sq m) and Q1 and Q4 of 2013 with 221,000 sq m and 229,000 sq m, respectively. So, events – devaluation of Russian Rouble and geopolitical situation have not yet led to a significant reduction in demand for office space in Q1. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;However, it should be noted that the actual level of net absorption of office space (the difference between occupied stock at the end and beginning of period) decreased significantly, as in Q4 2013 (94,700 sq m) and in Q1 2014 (50,000 sq m), against figures for Q1-Q3 2013 (187,000 sq m, 381,000 sq m and 293,000 sq m, respectively). Reduction in the amount of absorbed premises indicates that tenants in the current unstable situation virtually do not increase the amount of space occupied. The majority of tenants lease similar office size in another business centre.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 2014 only two large deals were closed in the Class A segment. PepsiCo leased 13,000 sq m at Alcon BC Phase I and Systematica – 17,000 sq m at office park Comcity Phase Alpha. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Class A Prime segment several small transactions with total area of 2,400 sq m were recorded. UTC leased 460 sq m at White Gardens BC, FASHION HOUSE Group leased 215 sq m at White Square BC. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Class B premises remained in high demand. 130,000 sq m of deals were leased or purchased in this segment. Russian companies made up a substantial part of the total (120,000 sq m). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The share of international companies in the total take-up volume is 16%. Throughout 2013 the share of international companies ranged from 15% to 30% quarterly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Class A segment international companies leased about 23,400 sq m (or 68% of the total area leased by international companies).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Primarily tenants were from energy, oil and gas, banking and IT sectors. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maximum take-up volume falls in the area between TTR and MKAD (48% of the total). CBD saw 18%; the zones between GR and TTR and beyond MKAD each had 17%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP reports that such a geographic distribution of deals transacted is expected to sustain in the future. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Along with it, an increase in activity beyond MKAD due to the delivery of a big amount of business parks that will offer high quality of office space and effective layouts as well as much lower rental rates compared to the rates inside the MKAD. A decrease in CBD might be observed due to the ongoing tenants’ policy to optimize and reduce the occupation costs.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;New delivery. During Q1 2014 a total of 209,000 sq m office space was put into operation, of which Class A accounted for 62% (130,400 sq m), Class B - 38% (78,600 sq m), including 40,000 sq m of built-to-suit. So, total office stock in Moscow reached 14.2 mln. sq m, 2.8 mln. sq m (or 19.7%) of which is Class A stock.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Estimated delivery for the remaining three consecutive quarters is expected to account for 400,000 sq m each.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 2014 the overall vacancy rate increased to 13% from 12% in 2013. Major changes have occurred in Class A segment due to the delivery of large volume of office space. So, Class A vacancy level reached 20.6%. This particularly affected Moscow-City due to the delivery of Eurasia Tower (86,800 sq m). The vacancy rate in the other areas of Moscow did not change dramatically: from 10,9% to 10% in CBD; from 12,3% to 11,8% in the area between TTR and MKAD, from 17,7% to 18,2% in the areas beyond the MKAD.     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Nevertheless, due to the large volume of new delivery, as well as continuing political instability and, as a consequence, the economic situation, we expect that within a year most of the transactions will be concluded at the rents close to the lower level of the range.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Unlike the previous years, 2014 demonstrates change in supply that may significantly exceed demand. Negative revision of macroeconomic indicators of Russian economy for 2014, widens the gap between supply and demand, both are prerequisite for increasing vacancy and decreasing rents.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Intensity of events in early 2014 leaves us hopeful that the situation will settle down in Q2 2014 and market participants may attain certainty regarding future economic scenarios which will not be reviewed on a quarterly basis. The next quarter appears to be pivotal, when possible seasonal decline in oil prices and shifts in geopolitical situation may occur. Accordingly, there is a chance of increased demand in H2 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The area between TTR and MKAD has the most successful market positioning and benefit from steady demand.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Offices in Moscow-City remain in a more complex situation that imposes the need to implement a more aggressive approach to attract tenants. There will be commissioned fairly significant office buildings, which further aggravate the competition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Regardless of unstable geopolitical situation and deteriorating economic indicators in Russia, we haven’t registered any significant changes in Moscow office market in Q1 2014. In Q1 take-up volume is comparable to the previous quarters. Several large-scale Class A properties were put into operation. Class A share in new delivery exceeded Class B share which is a rare case for Moscow market. New office projects announced for commissioning till the year-end are at the active stage of construction. Negative political perception of Russia, as well as forecasts for deterioration of economic performance in 2014 influenced mainly the premium office segment. Owners of Class A buildings in central locations with high vacancy rates are ready to offer individual commercial terms to reliable tenants that include such incentives as basic fit-out, longer rental holidays etc.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The UK recorded &amp;euro;12.4 billion worth of transactions in Q1 2014 - up 5% on the same quarter last year. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of this total was made up of properties outside Central London - up from 61% in the previous quarter and marking the highest proportion recorded since Q4 2011. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;About €1.2 billion (&amp;pound;1 billion) worth of transactions by foreign investors took place outside Central London in Q1 2014, including nine transactions from Asian and Middle Eastern investors. Non-European capital has increasingly spread into regional UK cities since the bottom of the market in Q2 2009 more than doubling market share from 7% to 18% in Q1 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Non-Central London investment was historically at its highest in Q1 2009 at 83% of total UK investment. If this level marks the potential upside, then the rest of the UK may see significant uplift in investment throughout 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;London was targeted by a wealth of cross-regional investment at the end of last year, in particular buyers from Asia and the Middle East who were keen to acquire prime assets in one of the world's leading cities. The fierce competition has led to a shortage of available stock in Central London; therefore, investors are turning their attention to the UK&amp;rsquo;s major regional cities such as Edinburgh and Manchester. This is evident in the recent momentum of regional office investment in the UK and the corresponding yield compression.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The European commercial real estate investment market overall started the year strongly with €38.9 billion in Q1 2014 - up 21% on Q1 2013. This is the highest Q1 total since 2008.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;However, following an exceptionally robust Q4 2013, the Q1 2014 total was well below last quarter’s €62.4 billion. Nearly three quarters of the entire European commercial real estate investment market is made up of the top four markets: the UK (32%), Germany (25%), France (9%) and Sweden (7%). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Spain, Ireland and Italy all saw year-on-year increases in investment activity in Q1 2014 as investors continue their climb up the risk curve. Spain has edged its way back, recording €988 million in turnover and taking up an increasing share of the European investment market (3%). Ireland (2%) recorded its highest quarterly total since 2006 at €939 million. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investments in the European commercial real estate are in cyclical growth phase and might exceed €200 bln. in 2014. Investors continue moving forward across risk curve and indicate increasing readiness to invest in regional cities in UK and Germany, as well as in peripheral economies. Moscow, which is usually in top 5-7 of the most attractive for investment cities, nowadays experiences problems due to the geopolitical risks. The latter might trigger 40-50% drop in investment volumes. Nonetheless, chances for increase in investment activity in H2 are still there. Especially, if we witness the coming good news about perspectives of economic cooperation with China and formation of a clear scenario to de-escalate situation in Ukraine.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow is in the TOP-3 world cities in terms of  international chain retailers that operate on the market&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 28 May 2014 &amp;ndash; Paris is the world&amp;rsquo;s hottest global retail market attracting 50 new brands last year, while France is ranked as the leading country for new entrants, according to the latest edition of How Global is the Business of Retail by global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The 2014 report which tracks retailer’s movements in 2013, found that the overall footprint of global retailers at country level grew by 1.7%. Over half of retailers (51%) are now present in all three major global regions, The Americas, Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific, a slight increase on the previous year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retailers focused on fewer and larger markets in 2013 with 18 of the top target cities considered mature markets compared with only 14 the previous year. 83% of the survey cities saw at least one new entrant throughout the year (compared with 81% the year before); with the top target markets seeing a 28% rise in new entrants. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The number of new entrants at city level was up by 26% year-on-year, with an increasing number of retailers crossing borders to grow their businesses. Paris has risen in popularity among the cities most attractive to retailers welcoming 50 new entrants over the year, including 10 new Luxury &amp;amp;amp; Business Fashion Brands. Paris benefitted from three new shopping centres in 2013, but it was the prime high street locations that attracted most global brands. Competition on these high streets between luxury brands is fierce due to surging demand from tourists, especially from China.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;France also topped the table of the hottest countries ahead of Japan and Hong Kong. France has seen a renewed confidence in the market. Paris was the main point of entry for many retailers and has seen rents increase to decade highs due to significant interest from global retailers for the limited amount of available prime space. Paris was not the only target market; retailers also chose nine other French cities for their first store.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Tokyo is second as the most attractive city for global retailers, seeing double the number of new entrants during 2013 (48) than it did in 2012, reflecting renewed confidence in the economic prospects of Japan. Half of all new entrants (24) came from the US while a further 18 were from Europe. Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi were the third and fourth &amp;lsquo;hottest’ markets with 43 and 42 new entrants respectively. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London is the home of more international brands than any other city, yet it still attracted 31 new market entrants last year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the new rating How Global is the Business of Retail, Moscow was the 7th most active market in terms of international brands’ new entrances in 2013.  Russian capital observed the same intensiveness of activity as London and Shanghai. New entrants work in all price segments, though the number of new luxury brands declined compared to the previous years. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;60% of international chains, which entered Moscow market, are European by origin, 35% - from USA, and the last 5% - 2 Japanese brands: Marukame and Miki House. 24 new retail chains opened their first stores in the shopping malls. Fashion retailers were especially addicted to this trend. Vast majority of new international brands entrances was realized via shopping and entertainment centers Afimall City, Mega Belaya Dacha, and Atrium.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;At the same time Moscow continued improving its position in terms of amount of famous international brands already working in the city. Russian capital entered top-3 world cities in this regard, being behind just London and Dubai. By the end of 2013 45% of international chain retailers had their stores in the city, same as in New York. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2014-2015 we expect to see around 1,2 mln. sq m of new supply of quality retail space. Such remarkable schemes as Avia Park, Columbus, Mozaika, Vegas Crocus City will see the market. These new opportunities will incentivize further interest of international players to the Moscow retail market. Despite significant economic and geopolitical instability, observed in Jan – May 2014, 14 new international chains have already entered Moscow market in 2014. At least, 16 other foreign players announced their plans to enter till the end of 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;As expected, in the second part of Q2 a few positive signals came to the market. These signals increase the probability of a positive macroeconomic scenario in 2014-2015. In this regard, GDP growth rate might exceed 0,5% and retail sales will continue growing, though with slower rates compared to the previous years. This situation forms a solid ground for higher retailers’ activity in the H2 2014.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jose Luis Martin, EMEA Senior Director of Cross Border Retail, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The improving economic prospects in Western Europe and North America is leading global retailers to refocus their expansion plans on mature markets and the world’s major retail destinations, with Paris, Tokyo, London and Berlin the top targets. Retailers have also turned their attention to recovering European markets and Asian and South American cities where they are still under represented. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Global shopping centre development is also at an all-time high and is providing the opportunity for retailers to enter new markets, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Owners are putting sizable resources into revamping, extending and freshening up their existing centres and securing major international brands is a key part of this strategy.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The growth of the online environment has also elevated the importance of the brand – not just among luxury retailers, but across the retail spectrum with consumers seeking out aspirational brands as well as high street and value offerings, and this is driving demand for new stores.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2012, the state program was launched &amp;amp;quot;Development of transport system of the city of Moscow&amp;amp;quot; that outlines transport development until 2020. Moscow Government continues to actively expand paid parking coverage and increase parking rates. Parking rate within Boulevard Ring increased by 60% since 2012. Introduction of paid parking within Garden Ring did not affect parking rates within business centers. In the long term demand for office space in the city center and Moscow-City may drive parking prices up.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Municipal parking rates for 2014&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;80 rubles per hour inside Boulevard Ring&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;60  rubles per hour between Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;80 rubles per hour for the first two hours and 130 rubles for the following hours on 14 streets adjacent to Moscow-City &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;If you park on municipal paid parking during working hours on weekdays for a month, the cost of parking inside Boulevard Ring reaches $450 per lot per month, $340 &amp;ndash; inside Garden Ring. The cost of municipal parking on average is comparable to underground parking in BC in corresponding zones. Municipal parking rates in Moscow-City surrounding area makes an exception. The cost of municipal parking reaches $670 per lot per month, which exceeds the average parking rental rate in the underground parking facilities of Moscow-City by more than 20%. In this regard, we expect that the most notable changes in the transportation choices by business commuters will occur in this area.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Tenants do not consider parking a key factor when choosing an office, but it is considered as a sum of all factors. We expect that the tenants, for whom the central location is not crucial for business image, will be motivated to move beyond the Third Transport Ring &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Igor Makarov, Analyst of Office Research Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;As experience of paid parking within Boulevard Ring shows, paid parking is an effective incentive to abandon personal vehicles in favor of public transport.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Due to the fact that in the area surrounding Moscow-City paid parking costs about $670 per lot per month, introduction of paid parking may force some of Moscow-City employees to use public transport, in the long term it will alleviate traffic situation around Moscow-City .&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Currently introduction and price increase of paid parking did not affect rental rates of offices and parking in the business centers located within the Garden Ring .&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Over 60% of the capital invested in I&amp;amp;amp;L in EMEA in Q1 2014 was channelled into the UK and Germany at €1.5bn and €1.3bn respectively, helping push the total turnover for the region to €4.34bn. This was up 5% compared with the same period in 2013 and the highest first quarter figure since 2008. Elsewhere there was notable activity in France, the Netherlands and also the Nordic countries highlighting a continued investor appetite for I&amp;amp;amp;L assets that has been boosted by the uplift in economic sentiment evident throughout Europe since mid- 2013. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;James Markby, Head of Industrial and Logistics investment, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;There is no shortage of equity or debt looking to catch the start of the up cycle for European logistics. We are also going to see material volume increases in Sweden, Central Europe, and The Netherlands. I&amp;amp;amp;L markets are currently going through a structural repricing, but there is still a long way to run, given that European logistics is attractively priced compared to other sectors and regions. Fundamental drivers are making many locations look attractive, with vacancy rates below 5% and little new inventory stock coming through in the short term. It will be an important few years for those that can access the right deals.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The EMEA Prime Yield Index fell a further 5 basis points in the quarter, with prime yields in the UK seeing the biggest quarterly decrease, but markets including Ireland and Spain also experiencing downward movements.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;On the occupier side, prime rents remained broadly stable in Q1 2014, but take-up of I&amp;amp;amp;L space continues to fluctuate by market mirroring the variable speeds of economic recovery across the region. Prague, Lyon and Regional Poland saw some of the most notable increases in demand for Warehouse space, while there was also further evidence of a gradual economic recovery in Southern Europe. Lisbon saw warehouse take-up increase 17% year-on-year and in Madrid and Barcelona, occupiers became more active in the market for larger units (above 25,000 sq m).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The lack of development in I&amp;amp;amp;L around Europe persists as a result of which build-to-suit projects are favoured by occupiers and developers alike. Speculative schemes will begin to increase, but initially only in a limited number of stronger locations. The demand for specialised spaces such as XXL warehouses (&amp;amp;gt;50,000 sq m) and parcel delivery centres is also continuing to rise.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Industrial and Logistics Research, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“As investment turnover in Europe reached the highest first quarter total since 2008, it is clear that Industrial and Logistics property remains firmly on the agenda of international investors. The attraction to mature markets such as Germany and the UK continued in Q1 2014, but markets elsewhere in Western Europe, the Nordics and increasingly those of Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe look set for further investor activity due to improving economic sentiment, limited prime stock and high levels of investor competition in traditional markets.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“European investors continue betting on the expected economic recovery in Europe. Another record in investment volumes highlights investors&amp;rsquo; high demand for I&amp;amp;amp;L space, which might be one of the important beneficiaries of the expected growth in consumption and production. Russian I&amp;amp;amp;L property market is even more attractive for the players, but currently it is under pressure of the geopolitical risks. As a result, investors prefer to remain in “on-hold” mode. Nonetheless, both $1.3 bn. invested in Russian I&amp;amp;amp;L properties in 2013, and 1.6 mln. sq m of new warehouse space to be delivered in 2014, confirm that fundamental interest to the Russian market will grow in line with respective decrease in geopolitical risks.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 11 June 2014 &amp;ndash; Corporate real estate occupiers are expected to return to the market with new office space requirements across Europe as 2014 progresses, according to the latest research from CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research, at CORE.XP, explains:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;It is no secret that in recent years corporate occupiers have been constrained by stringent cost management strategies born out of the economic downturn. As a result, we have seen a contraction in total office take-up levels across Europe, with the overriding commercial real estate trends being consolidation, cost savings, or operational streamlining. Now, things are changing in line with an improving economic environment, which we expect to have material impact on the office market this year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“One effect is that prime office rents are expected to increase as corporate demand to lease or acquire space accelerates. With grade A space in short supply across Europe, compounded by a thin office development pipeline, the expectation is that prime rents will move to an upward trajectory in more markets.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite this expected future growth, total aggregate European office take-up for the first quarter of 2014 remained on par with other recent first quarters. However, there were some encouraging market performances, namely Madrid and Paris. Madrid&amp;rsquo;s first quarter take-up was just under 100,000 sq m for the period, a marked improvement on other recent first quarters, driven by occupiers taken advantage of low rents in prime central locations with many small and mid-size deals recorded. Likewise, two transactions exceeding 40,000 sq m each in Paris, alongside a plethora of consolidation projects bolstered the French capital’s take-up to 506,000 sq m, a substantial improvement on recent quarters.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As 2014 progresses, the tight supply of high quality office space and growing occupier confidence supported by positive economic signals is expected to move more markets into prime rental growth. This has already started in some of the stronger markets, with London a stand out performer including the West End recording a 5% prime rent increase to &amp;pound;105 per sq ft per annum in the first quarter of the year. Amsterdam and Munich saw an increase of 1.5% each respectively over the same period, with both cities experiencing demand for buildings with well-equipped office space and high levels of amenities for employees. As a result, Munich has just 35,000 sq m of space available in the city centre pushing prime rents to stand 5% higher than 12 months ago at &amp;euro;33 per sq m per month.  This trend is not confined to the West of Europe with the Nordic cities of Oslo and Stockholm seeing a similar pattern with both recording prime rental growth of 5.2% and 2.3% respectively over the same period. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mike Gedye, Executive Director, EMEA Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“It is evident that there has been a shift in the priorities for corporate real estate occupiers over the last year. Concern about the impact of weak economies has diminished significantly with future growth opportunities now a core part of portfolio planning again. Accompanying this shift, is a heightened focus on the quality of location, the attraction and retention of talent and the internal built environment resulting in a higher demand for prime office space which, given the constrained supply, is driving up costs.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The majority (84%) of transactions in Moscow were signed by domestic companies in Q1, with caution prevailing amongst international firms. With demand suffering and a large volume of new supply coming through to the market, vacancy is set to increase which will put downward pressure on rents in the coming quarters.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In contrast to the demand growth in Western Europe, Moscow office market remains under pressure, due to the geopolitical situation and forecasts for deterioration of Russian economic performance in 2014 and 2015. However, despite the negative political perception of Russia and frozen decision making processes Q1 take-up volume decreased by 3% compared to Q1 2013. In Q1 it was registered the recovery of demand for high quality office space centrally located in Western Europe. In Moscow office market we see the opposite trend: in Q1 around 50% of the total take-up was done beyond the Third Transport Ring, Class B share in the total take-up was 60%. Tenants still actively consider Class A premises in the CBD but try to get better commercial terms.  Owners of Class A buildings in central locations with high vacancy rates are ready to give individual commercial terms to reliable tenants. These terms include such incentives as basic fit-out, longer rental holidays, etc.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$85bn to Flow into UK; Italy Germany, France, Spain also Key Targets&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 19 June 2014 – Middle Eastern investors are expected to spend US$180 billion in commercial real estate markets outside of their own region over the next decade, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The major increase in flows of Middle Eastern capital into global markets is emerging from the extraordinary mismatch between the lack of institutional real estate in domestic markets and the huge spending power concentrated in the region. Europe is the preferred target with 80% of the $180 billion (around $145 billion) targeted for the region over the next 10 years. Close to $85 billion will flow into the UK, with $60 billion directed at continental Europe. France, Germany, Italy and Spain are among the key target markets. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Global real estate markets have seen significant inflow of Middle Eastern capital with $45 billion invested between 2007 and the end of 2013 – seven times the reported activity in its home market. With $20 billion invested outside their home region in commercial property in the last two years alone – there is strong evidence that Middle Eastern players are increasing their interest and investment allocations to direct real estate.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/d8a/ME Investments eng.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;ME Investments eng.png&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;ME Investments eng.png&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;700&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;361&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Middle East Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are now among the world&amp;rsquo;s largest and most influential sources of capital, accounting for 35% of SWFs Assets Under Management (AUM) globally. When compared to Western and Asian SWFs, these funds currently allocate the smallest share (9% of total portfolio) to alternative assets. A further increase in allocation by Middle East SWFs, even by a small fraction, represents an extremely large amount of capital that would have a significant impact on the global commercial real estate market. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The average target allocation to real estate by global SWFs is 7.9% . Applying this to the $2.2 trillion in AUM held by Middle Eastern SWFs gives a total close to $175 billion. CORE.XP has explored a range of scenarios, including faster and slower growth of AUM by SWFs; a conservative estimate puts investment in global real estate by Middle Eastern SWFs at $130-140 billion over the next decade. Taking this figure with the expected spending of private Middle Eastern investors, as well as property companies and developers, equates to around $180 billion that will flow cross-border and into global markets over the next ten years. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Nick Maclean, Managing Director, CORE.XP Middle East, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The 'buy and hold' strategy adopted by many Middle Eastern investors within their home region and the resultant lack of deal flow opportunities leaves much unsatisfied demand here. Coupled with increased confidence in global markets and the need for diversification, overseas investment has grown strongly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Since the Global Financial Crisis, SWFs from the Middle East have become one of the most significant sources of capital in the global real estate landscape. The demand from these institutions has evolved during the last few years into a sophisticated source of liquidity for many of the mature real estate markets around the world. This trend is set to continue and with new sources of Middle Eastern capital, particularly from Saudi, set to enter the market over the next couple of years, the importance of this region on the global investment stage cannot be understated.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Close to 90% of all Middle Eastern commercial real estate investment outside of the home region in 2013 was in Europe. This is in sharp contrast to Asian capital that has become increasingly diverse geographically in the last 18 months. While there will be an increase in allocations towards the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, the majority (80%) of direct Middle Eastern investment will target Europe as it offers diversification, cultural acceptance, high liquidity and market transparency. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Around $85 billion of the total allocation will be invested in the UK, with continental Europe expected to receive $60 billion – almost five times the level of direct investment by Middle Eastern investors in the previous decade. Germany and Italy are key targets with Spain, particularly the hotel sector, now a strategic destination. France has developed close ties with Middle Eastern investors in recent years and offers a vast choice of trophy assets, so will continue to attract strong demand for core product and sectors.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The vast majority of Middle Eastern investors are long-term players looking for wealth preservation and strong high income-producing assets, rather than opportunistic investors playing the cycle for short-term gains. This strategy favours prime buildings in core markets and often very large lot sizes. Offices feature heavily in their acquisitions, while in the last couple of years there has been greater interest shown in retail, as illustrated by a string of high street acquisitions in London and Paris, as well as provincial cities in the UK and France. Interest in hotels is also noticeable and extends from a historic interest in the hospitality sector in home markets.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Iryna Pylypchuk, EMEA Research and Consulting, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Culture, openness and favorable taxation laws are significant push factors for Middle Eastern buyers towards Europe, and the UK in particular. Close historical, political and economic relations, as well as Britain’s recent decision to become the first non-Muslim nation to issue Sharia-compliant Islamic bonds, confirm Europe as the favoured destination for Middle Eastern capital.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While some increase in interest towards the Americas is expected, the need for Middle East investors to diversify away from US dollar-dominated investments will counteract the fundamental attractiveness of real estate as an asset choice. CORE.XP estimates that about 10% of the capital (around $18 billion) will flow into the region. This represents an average annual investment of around $1.8 billion, notably above the $1.2 billion invested in 2013, which in itself was relatively high by recent standards.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The diversification benefits that the Asia Pacific region offers could lead to a change in strategy for Middle Eastern investors. The number of deals completed in the region has been on the increase, but how quickly that interest will crystalize into a more robust pace of acquisitions, rather than a small number of large asset deals, remains to be seen. CORE.XP expects that the remaining 10% of the $180 billion will be intended for allocation towards Asia Pacific.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“To large extent, Russian commercial real estate market remains terra incognita for the investors from the Middle East. Since 2007 they had invested there just around $1 billion, with the largest chunk having come from Israel. Non-economic reasons are among key explanations of Middle East investors’ low activity. Current geopolitical situation, as well, does not contribute to their neutralization. Nonetheless, in long term investors from the Middle East are expected to increase their activity in Russia.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Los Angeles &amp;ndash; Moscow  &amp;mdash; June 26, 2014 — London&amp;rsquo;s West End remained the world’s highest-priced office market, but Asia continued to dominate the world’s most expensive office locations, accounting for three of the top five markets, according to CORE.XP Global Research and Consulting’s semi-annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs survey. The study also found that rents are rising fastest in the Americas, where real estate fundamentals continue to improve significantly. Overall, the U.S. accounted for five of the 10 markets with the fastest growing occupancy costs. These markets were Seattle (Suburban), San Francisco (Downtown), San Francisco (Peninsula), Houston (Suburban) and Houston (Downtown). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London West End’s overall occupancy costs of US$277 per sq. ft. per year topped the &amp;ldquo;most expensive&amp;rdquo; list. Hong Kong (Central) followed with total occupancy costs of US$242 per sq. ft. Beijing (Finance Street) (US$194 per sq. ft.), Beijing (Central Business District (CBD)) (US$187 per sq. ft.) and Moscow (US$165 per sq. ft.) rounded out the top five. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Phillip Howells, Executive Director, Central London, at CORE.XP said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Economic improvements have continued to trigger strong demand for space in the capital. As a result, the market has accelerated significantly over the last 18 months, with leasing activity improving in the core West End market of Mayfair &amp;amp;amp; St James’s in particular. This is evident at the top end of the market with specialised financial occupiers particularly active and rents being achieved significantly in excess of &amp;pound;100.00 per sq ft. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“A shortage of space combined with rising demand has pushed rents higher in London’s West End. With prime space leasing at a premium in this market, and the continuation of steady demand for offices, we anticipate stronger rental growth during the remainder of the year.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Global prime office occupancy costs rose 2.3% year-over-year, led by the Americas (up 3.3%) and Asia Pacific (up 2.9%). Meanwhile, EMEA was essentially flat, edging down 0.1% year-over-year. The regional results are consistent with recent economic trends, in that the American economy has been stronger than EMEA’s over the past year. While Asia Pacific exhibited the highest economic growth of the three regions, it also has a large pipeline of office projects, which is beginning to put downward pressure on costs in key markets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“We believe that occupancy costs are poised to accelerate in the latter part of 2014. Even though occupiers remain cost conscious, demand for prime office space is continuing to increase,” said Dr. Raymond Torto, Global Chairman, CORE.XP Research. “With the exception of a few markets, mostly in Asia Pacific, there is not a sufficient volume of new construction to meet demand. As such, market rents for prime properties are expected to continue rising, which, coupled with the higher cost of operating office buildings, will push up occupancy costs in most markets in the coming months.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP tracks occupancy costs for prime office space in 126 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 21 were in EMEA, 20 were in Asia Pacific and 9 were in the Americas. &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Occupancy cost comparisons in U.S. dollars are affected by currency exchange rates. However, the annual percent change in occupancy costs are in local currency and are not influenced by currency changes (except Jakarta, Indonesia where leases are typically written in U.S. dollars, but paid in rupiah, which means the occupancy cost increase is greatly affected by the currency depreciation in Indonesia). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;EMEA was home to the world’s most expensive market, with London West End at US$277 per sq. ft. per annum. Development restrictions in the West End keep vacancy rates comparatively very low. The improvement in the U.K. economy has triggered a strong recovery in the demand for space. This demand, along with the shortage of available space, has been putting upward pressure on prime rents throughout 2013 and into 2014.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Other markets from the region in the list’s top 10 are Moscow (US$165 per sq. ft.), London City (US$154 per sq. ft.) and Paris (US$124 per sq. ft.). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Rental rates for Moscow office remain one of the highest in the world. So, Moscow has the 5th rating position. Having reached their post-crisis level in Q3 2011, Prime Class A rents did not change throughout 2012 – H1 2014. The rents vary from $1,050 up to $1,200 per sq m net of OpEx and VAT. Due to the limited demand for Class A space centrally located, the rents remain flat. During the last several years cost saving strategy is one of the major drivers for tenants, that’s why the majority of deals take place in decentralized office projects (around 50% of the total take-up volume). Another factor influenced tenants behavior in H1 2014 is negative geopolitical situation and forecasts for deterioration of economic performance of Russia. That’s why many occupiers continue to exercise caution in their expansion plans. We expect the tenants to start their relocation projects in H2 2014 if the shifts in geopolitical situation occur. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Due to the economic recovery in USA and Western Europe, in Q1 2014 it was registered the increase of demand for high quality office space centrally located. Limited pipeline of new office projects in the city center and, as a consequence, low vacancy rates, push the Prime rents to grow in USA, Western Europe and some Asian markets. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the pipeline of projects announced for delivery in 2014 in Moscow, new supply is expected to be around 1.4 mln sq m. Considering the large volume of new supply and limited demand for office space, we expect the vacancy level to increase and the rents to remain under pressure. However, due to the limited new office development in the city center and recovery of demand of “Prime” tenants for whom the central location is a part of their business strategy, Prime rental rents will go up in the long term.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Both Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and Lyon, France, posted double-digit decreases in prime occupancy costs, falling 13.0% and 10.8%, respectively, over the past 12 months, a reflection of the effects of the lingering Eurozone crisis.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research at CORE.XP, added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;EMEA is an interesting region. It has four of the top ten most expensive office markets, including the world's most expensive, and two of the top fiver risers. Yet, it also accounts for three of the top five fallers.  This shows that the EMEA office market is hugely diverse, reflecting an uneven pace of recovery from the European debt crisis which has hit markets for much of the last 6 years. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Looking ahead, as economic sentiment improves, demand for prime office space is expected to accelerate which will be compounded by a weak office construction pipeline. This means three things for occupiers, act now to secure leases in prime buildings, strike attractive deals by de-risking pre-lets which might otherwise not be fundable, or snap-up accessible and good quality secondary space at attractive rates as there is a surplus in some markets.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Asia-Pacific had 20 markets ranked in the top 50 most expensive, including six of the top 10— Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Beijing (CBD), Hong Kong (West Kowloon), New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD) and Tokyo (Marunouchi Otemachi).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hong Kong (Central) remained the only market in the world other than London’s West End with an occupancy cost exceeding $200 per sq. ft. per annum. Hong Kong (West Kowloon) dropped one spot to sixth place amid an 8.0% decrease in occupancy costs due to the addition of new office space at a time that occupiers are moving cautiously in the market. However, occupancy costs in both markets are anticipated to start increasing in the coming months. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;West Kowloon, just 10 minutes away via subway from Central, is already home to big investment banks and has emerged as an attractive location for cost-conscious occupiers looking for quality space near the central business district. Leasing activity in West Kowloon had slowed down in the past year, but demand for smaller space picked up considerably after the Chinese New Year, although the market’s low vacancy level has made it difficult for larger occupiers to find suitable space options.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$106 per sq. ft. per annum), which came in at 17th place. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;High-tech- and energy-related businesses in markets such as Seattle (Suburban), San Francisco (Downtown), San Francisco (Peninsula), Houston (Suburban) and Houston (Downtown) reported some of the strongest annual prime office occupancy gains, with Seattle (Suburban) posting a significant 19.4% annual increase in occupancy costs. Rents in these markets have increased as a result of extremely tight market conditions, as strong demand from technology and energy tenants, combined with low vacancy rates, has given landlords leeway to increase rents significantly. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Americas was again led by New York Midtown, which posted a prime office occupancy cost of US$121 per sq. ft., which ranked as the 11th most expensive market in the world.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rio de Janeiro remained the most expensive market in Latin America, posting an office occupancy cost of US$110 per sq. ft. and ranking as the 13th most expensive market globally. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London 2 July, 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP has advised on the successful sale of the 19-asset Curve Portfolio on behalf of SEB for approximately &amp;euro;350 million to global investment firm, Blackstone and to market leading investment fund management house, Tritax. This is the most geographically diverse logistics portfolio ever sold in Europe. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The 18-strong collection of core logistics assets acquired by Blackstone for €275 million is spread across eight European countries: Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The final asset in the portfolio, located in Doncaster, England, was a 70,147 sq m warehouse with an average unexpired lease term of over five years, which was sold separately to Tritax for approximately €74 million. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The combined portfolio boasts a total of 504, 444 sq m of lettable space with a rent roll in excess of €24 million per annum across 35 tenancies. The Curve Portfolio assets are held across various funds with three held in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and 16 as property assets. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;James Markby, Head of EMEA Industrial and Logistics Investment, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The Curve Portfolio is the most geographically diverse logistics portfolio to ever be sold in Europe.  The interest we received is testament to the high level of investor demand for quality logistics assets across the continent. “We timed the sales to coincide with the uplift in economic sentiment throughout the region, and the return of investor focus on logistics assets in markets previously considered peripheral, including Austria, Hungary, Norway and Spain.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The complete acquisition, from the start of marketing to exchange of contracts was completed in less than 12 weeks.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Majority of Russians Purchase Non-food Items in Large-scale Shopping Malls&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 3 July 2014 &amp;ndash; The report &amp;lsquo;What Do Russians Think about Shopping Malls?&amp;rsquo; by the global property advisor CORE.XP reveals the key success factors for a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/estate/retail/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;shopping mall&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; such as: attractive prices, cleanliness, convenience of access to the shopping mall (less than 30 minutes), and opportunity to spend time with family. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP surveyed 1,000 consumers in 7 Russian Federal Districts. Respondents differed by age, income level, marital status and size of household. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Highlights from the report include:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The majority of respondents purchase clothes and shoes, accessories, jewellery, household goods, etc. in regional and super regional shopping and entertainment complexes with a gross leasable area (GLA) of more than 40,000 sq m. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consumers indicated that price of goods, cleanliness and location were the most important factors when choosing where to shop.  The percentage of respondents who mentioned these three factors was 73%, 69% and 62% respectively. In this regard Europeans have the same criteria when choosing a shopping centre for the purchase of non-food products.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Navigation inside shopping malls often becomes a crutial factor for many visitors as it is sometimes unclear and inconvenient. Typical problems usually include a lack of signs and difficulties in their interpretation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The neutrality of respondents to such factors as ‘Presence of specific retailers’ and ‘Tenant mix’ should also be mentioned.  The reason is mainly that the majority of shopping malls in Russia are very similar in terms of tenant mix and marketing concept.  Relatively weak competition has allowed developers to implement standard solutions in their shopping malls.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Such factors as ‘Presence of department stores’, ‘Good quality restaurants’, ‘Entertainment zone’, and ‘Marketing events’ have practically no influence when choosing where to shop. The importance of these factors was stressed by only 20% of respondents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;64% of respondents spend from 10 to 30 minutes to get to a shopping centre to purchase non-food items. Only 2% of Russians spend more than 1 hour to travel to a shopping centre.  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;On average, 48% of Russians travel to shopping centres by car, 32% use public transport and only 16% of  customers walk to the shopping centre.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The survey indicated that price of goods was the most important factor when choosing where to shop despite all marketing efforts to generate alternatives to attract customers to shopping malls.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Analyst of CORE.XP Russia &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research department&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;No doubts that location is the key success factor, and travel time to the shopping mall of over 30 minutes might reduce the number of visitors significantly. However, it is not enough, and owners (both national and international) should take into account the consumer’s priorities and regional specifics. Both of these factors significantly influence a shopping mall concept. Attention to details which had already migrated in the section “must&amp;rdquo;, is also very important. Such elements as free parking, convenient navigation, and detailed information brochures contribute to the positive perception of a shopping mall and increase of customers’ loyalty.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;For editors:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;* In April 2014 CORE.XP conducted a survey to discover where and how consumers shop for non-food items – particularly in relation to their changing expectations of different types of shopping destinations. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP surveyed 1,000 consumers in 7 Russian Federal Districts.  Respondents differed by age, income level, marital status and size of household. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The key idea behind this survey was to collect a number of hints and ideas for retail market players: developers and shopping centres owners. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Romania saw the greatest rise in commercial property investment volumes with close to 300% increase year-on-year, however, coming from low levels of activity. This can be explained by continued low interest rates, increasing allocation of institutional investors to real estate, relatively high yields and the belief that economic growth should be solid in the coming years.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Czech Republic and Hungary also saw significant increases in investment volumes with uplifts of 36% and 35% respectively. These two countries in particular have benefitted from the challenge that many investors have had in finding the product they are looking for in Poland. This  lack of supply has had a positive impact on neighbouring countries, which also can offer more attractive yields in the current market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite these increases, Russia and Poland continue to dominate commercial property investment in the region. Together they account for over 60% of the investment volume at €1.2 billion and €1.1 billion respectively. Poland&amp;rsquo;s real estate market continues to attract strong investment and the Polish economy - after a slight dip in recent quarters - is moving back into growth mode. Poland has moved away from being a niche market and continues to mature into one of the core investment locations in Europe. Russia, however, saw investment flows fall almost 60% over the first six months of the year. This is largely due to the well-publicised tensions with the Ukraine, but also reflects the irregularly high transaction activity in Q1 2013.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mike Atwell, Head of CEE Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The CEE investment market continues to benefit from a renewed interest from traditional CEE investors, but more recently the market has also begun to see new sources of global capital coming into the region. Poland remains the dominant market with numerous transactions ongoing and the forecast is for an overall increase in volumes by the end of 2014.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jos Tromp, Head of CEE Research &amp;amp;amp; Consultancy, CORE.XP, added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Continued low interest rates, combined with an improved economic outlook, has ensured commercial real estate remains a favoured asset for investors.  Within the CEE region, we believe that investor interest is actually stronger than the H1 2014 data suggests. Almost all markets have shown increasing liquidity levels, with the exception of Russia, which was clearly adversely affected by the Ukraine crisis. It is also important to remember that Russian deal flow was abnormally high for the same period in 2013. However, until the situation in the Ukraine settles down we expect cross-border investment into Russia to remain relatively slow”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anna Melnik, Head of Capital Markets &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP, Russia: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In Q2 2014 the volume of transactions increased by 1.5 times compared to Q1 2014, investment risks decreased, and investors continued searching for attractive opportunities. Nonetheless, the Russian CRE market remains under pressure of still high geopolitical risks and limited access to the international funding. Though Q2 2014 brought a number of positive signals from the real sector of economy, it is not sufficient for the full scale recovery of the investment activity in Russia. In H2 2014 investors are expected to continue following conservative policy in anticipation of the effective resolution of the situation in Ukraine”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Major trends of the Moscow office market in Q2 2014: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Record volume of newly delivered offices, 323,700 sq m  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Three Class A office buildings totaling 158,900 sq m were put into operation: President Plaza, Arcus III, Aurora BP Building F&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lowest take-up during the last thirteen years, 84,400 sq m (60% less than in Q1 2014). Low take-up is compensated by lease extension deals accounting for 30%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The majority of deals were completed within TTR (73%), though zone behind TTR remains the leader in new office delivery (74% of the delivered office premises)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;64% of closed deals were done in Class B buildings, in Class A &amp;ndash; 36% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The majority of deals were signed by Russian companies, 75% of the total&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The most popular office size blocks was up to 1,000 sq m, 82% of the total number of deals&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy in both Class A (from 20.6% in Q1 2014 to 24% in Q2) and B properties increased (from 10.8% to 12%) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The total vacancy reached 14.5% vs 13% in Q1 2014. As it approaches 16-17%, it may force lease rates below the current range&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stable rental rates&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The total Moscow office market take-up was 298,400 sq. m from the beginning of the year (46% of the same period in 2013). 84,400 sq m out of which refers to the deals closed in Q2 2014, the lowest during the last thirteen years.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Similar figures characterized 2000 and Q1 2001, when quarterly take-up figures varied between 48,000 and 97,000 sq m. Even in current geopolitical situation that influence the market during the past 6 months such a low number of completed deals was unexpected. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q2 the volume of Class A take-up reached 30,300 sq m (36%).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q2 Class B take –up was in majority (64%) and totaled to 54,100 sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The majority of the deals in 2014, were signed in office blocks of less than 1,000 sq m (82% of the total number of done deals in H1 2014). In Q2 there were only 3 lease transactions over 2,000 sq m (3% of total number of lease transactions). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The largest deal in the Class A segment was for 13,000 sq m GE consolidation at Naberezhnaya Tower, including lease extension for previously leased premises.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Shares of international and domestic companies in Class A lease structure are almost equal with 16,500 sq m and 13,800 sq m respectively. In Class B major part of deals was closed by Russian companies, 49,100 sq m, by international companies – 5,000 sq m. Typically international companies are more interested in Class A premises than in Class B. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Q2 was also not entirely conventional in terms of geographic distribution of transactions volume. Throughout 2012–2013, more than half of transactions occurred in the zone beyond TTR, in Q2 2014 – only 27%. The rest 73% were recorded inside TTR, of which 37% – in the CBD, 36% – in the area between GR and TTR. Take-up share beyond MKAD was less than 1%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;New delivery. Q2 2014 was the record quarter for the past 4 years in terms of new delivery. The total of 323,700 sq m office space was put into operation, of which Class A accounted for 49% (158,900 sq m), Class B – 51% (164,800 sq m). Overall H1 2014 new commissioning volume reached 532,800 sq m, of which Class A accounted for 289,300 sq m (54%). New construction level in Class A segment in H1 2014 has already exceeded the annual volumes for 2010–2013, with 277,700 sq m, 218,500 sq m and 224,600 sq m respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;So, the total office stock in Moscow sums up to 14.5 mln sq m, 2.9 mln sq m (20%) of which is Class A stock.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q2 2014 total vacancy rate increased from 13% in Q1 2014 to 14.5%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Major changes of vacancy level continue to occur in Class A segment, where vacancy rate increased from 20.6% to 24% due to delivery of large volume of Class A offices. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Class B segment vacancy rate increased from 10.8% to 12%, which may indicate relative preservation of balance between supply and demand levels in Class B segment.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Asking rental rates in Q2 2014 remained stable in comparison to Q1 2014: $1,050–$1,200 for Prime Class A, $650–$750 for Class A, and $400–$450 for Class B.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Development of negative geopolitical events, large volume of new delivery and continuing limited demand puts extra pressure on rental rates.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP, current geopolitical situation forces tenants to follow &amp;ldquo;wait-and-see&amp;rdquo; scenario at least until the end of Q3 2014. In this case the annual total may reach 650,000 sq m. If negative expectation in geopolitics begins to diminish annual take-up may attain 800,000 sq m, which will retain lease rates within current range.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/office_agency/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Office Agency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Regardless of extremely low take-up, absence of large deals in Q2 and negative net absorption we observe large number of relocation projects in progress. These projects range from 4,500 to 60,000 sq m and largely represent consolidation and search of the most beneficial solution in the current market conditions. Tenants active interest is a positive aspect, the choice of quality office projects is great. However, the main obstacle is to transform theses projects into transactions this year.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Business-complex on Partiyniy pereulok is located in 7-minutes walk from Serpukhovskaya metro station. The complex represents buildings of the former Vladimir Ilyich plant totaling  200,000 sq m. Many buildings in this complex are under reconstruction at the moment that is due to finish in 2016. The infrastructure of the complex includes canteens, cafes, a restaurant and  a large parking lot. 24-hours security is provided for the tenants. Access to the buildings is regulated by proxy cards. As in the past this business complex was industrial  today almost unlimited electric power is offered for the tenants which is unique for offices in the central Moscow. Apart from electricity power the complex has its own railway access that allows tenants to bring in and out heavy loads.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Aside from an exceptional Q4 2013, when a strong finish to the year led to the highest quarterly figure in Europe since Q4 2007, Q2 2013 is the largest investment total recorded since 2007.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;France saw a significant increase in investment volumes with €6.9 billion of transactions in Q2 2014, up 82% on the previous quarter and double the level seen in Q2 2013. In line with the wider economic situation the French commercial real estate investment market has been relatively flat in recent years. However, Q4 2014 recorded the highest quarterly total since Q4 2011. The increase in H1 2014 was largely due to a small number of large lot size deals and the historically low cost of money coupled with rents at the bottom of the cycle.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Nicolas Verdillon, Executive Director, Capital Markets France, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The strong activity is a welcome return to larger volumes in France where investment had been lagging the rest of Europe mainly due to lack of product. Institutional investors from all major economies are currently active or getting ready to enter the market and there is a more positive outlook taking hold.  Paris is an obvious choice in any international portfolio and with the CBD yields narrowing, investors are now turning to other established Paris sub-markets.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the UK, investors continued to be more active outside of Central London in the second quarter of 2014. Approximately 60% of total investment in the UK occurred outside the capital. In addition about €1 billion worth of transactions by foreign investors took place outside Central London in Q2 2014. This included ten transactions from Asian and Middle Eastern investors, one of which was for more than €200 million. Non-European capital has increasingly been spreading into regional UK cities since the bottom of the market in Q2 2009.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The growing interest in regional UK cities such as Birmingham and Manchester is partly due to strong competition for limited investment product in Central London but also reflects increased confidence from investors. Buyers particularly from Asia and the Middle East are now more willing to explore options beyond London as long as they can still buy central locations with quality leases in place.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Andrey Novikov, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/capital_markets/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Capital Markets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investments in European commercial real estate continue fast growth, setting up one record after another. Given no current geopolitical problems, investments in the Russian commercial real estate could be 1,5 - 2 times larger compared to the existing situation. Nowadays, it would be fine if this indicator for the whole 2014 exceeds $3,5 bn., i.e. will achieve, at least, 50% of 2013&amp;rsquo;s volume. Investors’ interest to acquisitions is still here, but existing geopolitical problems make it more difficult to reach compromise on pricing and, thus, increase the length of transactions. Nonetheless, unless oil prices decrease below $100 per barrel and GDP growth becomes negative, investors will continue the active search for good opportunities.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Ireland Boasts Strong Numbers Across All Sectors&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 22 July 2014 &amp;ndash; European commercial real estate markets saw continued growth in Q2 2014 with further yield compression supporting value growth across all property sectors and a number of markets also reporting modest rental increases, according to the EMEA Prime Rents and Yields survey from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s EMEA Prime Yield Indices continued to edge down across all sectors, with the all-property yield down by seven basis points (bps) in the quarter. The most pronounced changes occurred in the high street retail and shopping centre sectors, which fell by 11 and 16 bps respectively – the result of yields moving lower in over a third of retail markets sampled including the major cities in France, Germany and Italy. Prime yields across each of the three main commercial sectors are now at least 25 bps lower than they were a year ago, reflecting growing investor confidence.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;John Welham, Executive Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Investor demand for retail assets has improved significantly in the first half of 2014 with many new buyers entering the market, particularly from the U.S. In many markets prime shopping centre yields are approaching the level achieved at the top of the last cycle. Strong competition for assets means that sales processes are once again going through two or even three rounds of bidding, with prices rising through the process. At the same time, growing appetite for risk is generating good demand for core-plus and value-add properties. Investors believe that now is a good time to buy centres that have had a lack of investment during the last few years and to activate asset management plans that can release the value-add potential in the asset.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the office and industrial sectors, yields improved by between five and seven bps. There was little clear geographic pattern to these shifts, but office yields dropped in Paris, Milan Prague and industrials in Rotterdam, Warsaw and Stockholm. Dublin was a standout market with yields improving in the office and retail sectors, and rents rising in all three sectors in Q2 2014.  The strength of the bounceback in the Dublin market is reflected in the fact that office rents have risen by 33% over the past year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;More broadly, the rental picture is one of stability rather than general upward movement. Based on the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Rent Indices, retail and industrial rents rose by just under 0.5% in Q2 2014, and stayed flat in the office sector. Significant changes include the rise in prime London West End office rents to &amp;pound;107.50 per sq ft, and higher retail rents in Glasgow, Manchester, Oslo and Istanbul.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Commenting on the Q2 2014 rental statistics, Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research at CORE.XP, added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Recent economic indicators have been somewhat mixed across the eurozone and, while we continue to expect stronger numbers to come through in the second half, this is acting as something of a constraint on occupiers’ expansion appetite at least in the short term. On the supply-side, low vacancy rates in some markets and the more general weakness in development activity will serve to limit occupiers’ choice and should underpin more widespread rental growth from the second half of 2014.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“European CRE markets indicate trend of growth in asset prices: annualized increases achieve 3-10%. The largest price growth potential is expected in retail property segment. Growth potential is being unleashed quite carefully and is observed approximately at &amp;frac14; of the monitored markets. To large extent it is related to the perspectives of growth GDP acceleration in Eurozone in 2015. Due to the current geopolitical problems, prices of Russian assets are flat now, and in the nearest future might find themselves under downward pressure. Opportunities for prices increase are expected to appear closer to Q2 – Q3 2015. Nonetheless, investors, including these international, continue to analyze opportunities in Russia. Possible market tensions might help them to acquire perspective properties at attractive prices.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

Shopping centre development activity has largely remained concentrated in emerging markets, with a large proportion (84%) taking place in Central &amp;amp;amp; Eastern Europe (CEE), according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Across Europe, over 4.5 million sq m of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/retail_agency/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;shopping centre&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; space opened in 2013 with Russia, Turkey, Poland and France seeing the greatest completion of space respectively. Russia and Turkey remain the most active markets, with over 60% of Europe&amp;rsquo;s shopping centre completions in 2013 located in these two countries.  Russia has developed 1.5 million sq m of new stock in 2013. The development pipeline in Turkey continues to be notable with more than 2.6 million sq m of shopping centre space under construction in H1 2014. This high rate of construction is due to an improving economy and a continuing interest of developers in regional cities. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Other countries with notable shopping centre development in the pipeline include the Ukraine (793,759sq m), Germany (564,275), Poland (559,586), France (491,971) and Italy (489,167). As has been the trend for several years, much of the activity is taking place in CEE but Germany saw a significant increase in shopping centre stock under construction in 2014, following the completion of the Sky Plaza in Frankfurt in 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Natasha Patel, Associate Director, EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Shopping centre development activity levels in Europe are similar to what they were last year in terms of location, with new construction dominated by CEE. In Turkey the majority of development, certainly the larger schemes, is taking place in the major cities such as Istanbul with smaller scheme development taking place in the outer regions such as Izmir in Turkey. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The scale of new development is largely to due to economic growth in the region, a growing middle class and the increasing demands of cross-border retailers, many of whom have found that the existing retail space in the region does not meet their requirements.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Analyst, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research Department&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The period of strong macroeconomic improvement, consumer’s income growth and lack of quality retail space during 2012-2013 resulted in large volume of announced projects of shopping malls all over Russia. These projects cover not only cities where population exceeds 500,000 inhabitants, but also smaller towns.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Majority of projects are on the last stages of development, hence new delivery of shopping malls in Russia as of 2014 could be 1.5 times higher than new delivery in 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Current geopolitical situation and its influence on Russian economy would have downward pressure on new delivery of shopping malls in 2015. However, developers with small financial leverage have good opportunities to finalize their projects as consumer demand in long run will remain high.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;At the mean time offices remain the secure asset of capital protection with an attractive yield. Thus, even in current geopolitical environment, investment in offices can generate a higher return than that of residential property. And it is almost impossible to deposit capital in a bank at such a high yield. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Despite current geopolitical environment private investors are being  quite active in real estate market. Offices remain the secure asset of capital preservation with an attractive yield. Taking into account growing caution to ruble and foreign currency, investment into real estate looks as the most secure and conservative. This trend is supported by  current decline in commercial real estate prices and allows private investors to  buy high quality office premises at the optimal price.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In terms of location, the UK continues to capture the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of industrial investment, with the €3.46 billion invested in the sector this year (40% of total investment).  Germany, France and the Netherlands also saw significant activity over this period.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Nordics performed particularly well in H1 2014, with €878 million invested into the region, an almost 50% increase on H2 2013. The region began the year well with the highest quarterly total since 2007 in Q1 2014 and continues to attract large amounts of capital with high value sales, including a transaction of over €200 million in Sweden in the second quarter of 2014.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;James Markby, Head of EMEA Industrial and Logistics Investment, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The industrial sector’s continued growth in terms of both total investment and percentage of market share reaffirms its position as the sector which can generate attractive sustainable long term income returns, while also benefitting from capital growth along with the rest of the market. Many institutions are just beginning to allocate capital to the sector, and those that are already participating are looking for further increases.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; “All areas of the market are functioning well, the transaction pipeline and size of deals is growing and the occupier led development cycle is starting to produce some very interesting dynamics again. Lack of available stock is now the challenge to satisfy investor and occupier demands.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;On the occupational side, industrial take-up rose across most countries in the first half of the year.  Demand for warehouse space in core EMEA countries increased 42% year-on-year.  Paris, Milan and Budapest saw the strongest improvements in leasing activity, followed closely by Dublin and Amsterdam.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“One reason for the uptick in leasing transactions is that corporate funding is becoming more affordable and the economic outlook is much more positive. Therefore real estate decisions, which had previously been put on hold, or addressed through temporary solutions, are now back at the top of boardroom agendas. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“While demand is improving, there is still a mismatch between supply and demand.  The availability of modern stock in well located areas is limited, which leaves occupiers with the option of taking space in secondary locations, or initiating a build-to-suit project. Therefore most newly completed space tends to be build-to-suit, although we are now seeing renewed appetite and some speculative development in the more strategic western European markets.”  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Increase in interest to the European logistics property is explained by expectations of ending recession in Europe. In this regard eurozone follows Russia with some lag. In 2013 investments in industrial and logistics property in Russia reached 19% compared to 10,3% in eurozone and amounted to $1,34 bn. In 2014 Russian developers remain very active in delivery of new projects. However, demand currently is under influence of “war of sanctions”, leading to potential increase in vacancy above 8%. Same calming influence on the investment activity might occur in Europe, as well, as its economy already feels negative impact from sanctions. Nonetheless, we might witness a recovery in the industrial and logistics market balance in both markets in 2015, which might trigger further intensification in investment activity.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 29 August 2014 &amp;ndash; Russian commercial real estate market will find itself under pressure, at least, till Q1 2015, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;3 scenarios of market development are analyzed in the research:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;radical improvement in the geopolitical situation;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;continuation of high uncertainty;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;worsening geopolitical situation and macroeconomic fundamentals in mid-term period. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In all the 3 scenarios market balance will remain under pressure of the weakened demand. In Q2 2014 the latter was 30-50% below levels which we could witness in normal situation. It is worth mentioning, that increased uncertainty generated the strongest impact on the international companies: in normal situation their market share in demand fluctuated within 25-30% range, while now it is just around 10-15%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In &amp;ldquo;high uncertainty&amp;rdquo; scenario, assuming continuation of “war of sanctions”, take-up volumes in office segment in H2 2014 might be around 400 – 450 thousand sq m. In industrial and logistics segment this indicator might be around 440 thousand sq m. Both forecasts assume that GDP growth will remain positive. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;On the contrary, supply in H2 2014 might set up new historical highs in both industrial and logistics and retail segments combined with extensive new deliveries in offices. According to CORE.XP newly delivered 1,04 mln. sq m in industrial and logistics and 320 thousand sq m in retail segment might be witnessed till the end of 2014. In office market 0,8 mln. sq m is expected to be seen in H2 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Russian commercial real estate market formation of imbalance between supply and demand usually initially leads to increase in vacancy, but not to decline in rental rates. In Q2 offices vacancy rate increased from 12% to 14,5%. In industrial and logistics segment which is characterized by structural deficit of supply, this indicator grew up from 3% to 4,8%. Vacancy in retail segment was the most resilient and slightly increased from 2,6% to just 2,9%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;It is quite obvious, that vacancy rates will continue their growth against the background of high number of new deliveries and depressed demand. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the report, by late 2014 – early 2015 in “high uncertainty” scenario office segment will witness 16 - 18% vacancy, including that in class A at 26%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In this scenario peak of negative pressure is expected to occur in early 2015, when market will have to absorb large volume of new delivery. After this, market balance is expected to start the process of recovery. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In industrial and logistics segment by the end of 2014 vacancy might reach 8 -10%. In order to bring this indicator back to 4-5, developers will have to adjust their plans for 2015 to 0,5 mln. sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In retail vacancy might reach 5 - 6% of total stock.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;However, despite expected increase in downward pressure on the rental rates, CORE.XP does not forecast noticeable changes in capitalization rates. They are expected to remain stable in all segments of commercial real estate market. In addition, schemes with low vacancy and long term structure of leasing agreement will successfully resist against downward pressure on assets prices. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP, appearance of positive impulses from the macroeconomic side will not generate immediate improvement in CRE market balance. Though these impulses will contribute into the formation of positive trends on rental rates growth and decline in vacancy, the full strength of these trends is not expected to come until late 2015 – early 2016. However, landlords are expected to become much more reluctant in offering better commercial terms upon arrival of these impulses. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Thus, H1 2015 is in the position to become a “window of opportunity” to fix mid-term low rental rates.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Given 6+ months ahead to assess the market, develop strategy and close deal, tenants should be prepared for possible market bottom around the end of 2014 – beginning of 2015 to agree on mid-term deals at minimal costs. This will raise their chances to fix mid-term low rental rates in their current lease agreements or in the new ones.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Developers are recommended to decrease new construction activity as new projects are unlikely to expand in the next 12 – 18 months due to short / mid-term increase in vacancy in the market. However, despite weakening market balance, projects in good locations with quality concepts even in this difficult market environment will be in demand. Developers should be prepared to start construction of new schemes around the late 2015 – early 2016, as recovering demand can drive reduction in vacancy rate sooner than expected.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Given current sentiments and market situation, late Q4 2014 – early Q1 2015 might become a good time for investment transactions. Prices for stabilized assets with long-term structure of leasing agreements are expected to remain stable. One should not expect substantial discounts for income producing distressed assets, as property owners are much resilient today in terms of debt exposure. Competition between local investors, chasing opportunities, is high. Foreign players are also in the game. Opportunities are likely to arise in new quality developments with leasing risks or properties that require redevelopment or renovation.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Despite expected increase in supply-demand imbalance, commercial real estate market still has good chances to avoid substantial negative trends in its indicators. To realize them commercial real estate market needs to witness positive economic growth in 2015. Flow of negative news about commercial real estate market indicators is expected to continue until Q2 2015. However, 1-2 strong positive impulses from the geopolitical situation are able to initiate trends on decreasing vacancy and market stabilization. In the worst case scenario tenants&amp;rsquo; opportunities to secure mid-term low rental rates will not be limited by H1 2015 and will extend, following theoretically possible recession in 2015.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 2 September 2014 &amp;ndash; The European commercial real estate investment market continued its strong performance in H1 2014, with France and Germany the main drivers of growth and the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain making significant contributions, according to the latest research from CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Total commercial real estate investment reached &amp;euro;46 billion in Q2 2014, taking the total for the first half of the year to €84 billion. This compares to €67 billion in H1 2013. The rate of growth has been consistent since the end of 2012 at approximately 30% per annum. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;There was a big uptick in investment in France in Q2 2014 with €7.3 billion of transactions, bringing the H1 2014 total to €11.1 billion. This represents an 84% increase on the €6 billion recorded in the first half of 2013. The vast majority (69%) of transactions attracted domestic buyers, although France also saw a significant inflow of capital from the Middle East. This reversed the position in Q1 2014, when local buyers made up only 36% of the market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Germany investment activity reached nearly €7 billion in Q2 2014, bringing the H1 2014 total close to €17 billion. This represents a strong quarter when compared to the Q2 totals of previous years, despite a slight decrease on an exceptional Q1 2014. A notable feature of the German market in H1 2014 has been the growth in cross-border investment, with investors from the US, UK and France all active.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The continued growth in the European market has been achieved with countries such as the Netherlands (up by 109% H1 2014 compared to H1 2013), Spain (106%), and Sweden (30%) now making significant contributions. This is despite a relatively slow increase in the UK market over the last twelve months (11%).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;H1 2014 saw the completion of four separate transactions over €1 billion for the first time since 2007. The UK has dominated very large real estate transactions recently, so it is notable that two of these transactions took place in France, one in Germany and one multi-country portfolio. Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland recorded a higher proportion of Europe&amp;rsquo;s €100m+ transactions than would normally be the case&amp;mdash;19 between the three countries and almost double the historic average.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;There was also a significant shift in buyer type recorded in H1 2014, with the proportion of investment by collective investment vehicles—mostly property funds —seeing a sharp rise and the activity of institutional investors falling back equally sharply. The start of this shift was already evident in H2 2013, but the trend has continued in H1 2014 and now represents a significant turnaround in the market. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Direct institutional investment generally remains at the core and core-plus end of the real estate market throughout the property cycle, so it is no coincidence that this shift has come at a time when we are seeing greater risk taking by investors. However, the size and speed of the shift over just twelve months is yet another indication of how quickly sentiment has turned around.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The growth in the number of large portfolio transactions is also evidence of the strength of demand from investors, as is the growing potential for a &amp;lsquo;portfolio premium’, where investors are prepared to pay more for a portfolio than they would for the individual assets separately.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;H1 2014 also saw a significant increase in buying activity from U.S. based investors, with acquisitions reaching nearly €11.5 billion in H1 2014, compared to €6.3 billion in H1 2013. The UK attracted the majority of this investment (36%), with Germany (23%) and France (17%) also favoured destinations. Ireland and Italy also received over €0.5 billion of US investment. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most significant shift in terms of buyer nationality in Europe in H1 2014 was the jump in buying activity from US-based investors who were responsible for 63% of cross-regional investment in the region. Also notable was the shift to positive net investment from the U.S. In recent years sales by U.S. investors have nearly matched acquisitions; however, in H1 2014 alone acquisitions have exceeded sales by €4.5 billion.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;U.S. based investors targeted a range of European locations, with assets acquired in at least 15 European countries investment in H1 2014. The city that attracted the biggest concentration of U.S. investment was Paris at nearly €1.9 billion. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Chris Ludeman, Global President, Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“While the volume of business in U.S. commercial real estate is expanding, price movements in domestic markets and improving prospects in the European economy, have led U.S. investors to target Europe more ambitiously than has been the case in recent years. This investment is dominated by fund managers, rather than investors buying directly, so there is an extent to which they represent a conduit for global capital rather than just U.S. money. Nonetheless, the increase over the last few quarters has been remarkable.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Another feature is the range of locations that U.S. investors are seeking out with general pricing in Europe seen as attractive and ‘recovery play’ investments currently more accessible currently than in the U.S.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Demand for European commercial real estate continues its growth, fueled, primarily, by US investors. They generated about 2/3 of investment activity in Europe in H1 2014. This indicator in Europe growth at 20-30% rate 3rd year in a row. It is worth mentioning, that investment activity can change very quickly. Say, in Q2 this indicator increased by 94% in France and decreased by 30% in Germany. In Russia in H1 2014 investment operations amounted to €1,15 bn,, which is just 42% compared to the same period of 2013. However, in July – August we witnessed €791 mln. new investments, which is 2,3 times more than in July – August 2013. These figures confirm that Russian CRE market remains in investors’ focus. We expect that 2014’s investment volumes in the Russian CRE might reach USD 4 bn.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 25 September 2014 &amp;ndash; The demand for office space across Western Europe has hit its highest level since the financial crisis, according to the latest research from CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Corporate real estate occupiers are returning to the market with new office space requirements as   demand in the second quarter (Q2) of 2014 rallied by 21% on the first quarter, marking the highest Q2 office take-up in Western Europe since the economic downturn. Central to this was strong activity in Milan and Lisbon, while London retained its dominant position as a popular destination for corporate occupiers with a 29% quarterly take-up increase. Milan&amp;rsquo;s take-up more than doubled in Q2 to 94,000 sq m while Lisbon recorded one of its strongest quarters in recent years. In addition, the Paris office market which had been subdued during the downturn with occupiers lacking the confidence to relocate, posted its highest office take-up level for two years in Q2, representing a 28% uplift from Q1. Across Europe as a whole, aggregate take-up rose by a healthy 12.2% compared to the first quarter of the year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a result of this increased demand, the aggregate office vacancy rate in Western Europe fell in Q2. Central London saw a third consecutive quarterly decline in vacancy rates with prime space now in very short supply. Likewise, increased demand for office space in Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam also contributed to vacancy declines. Frankfurt saw the most noticeable drop, where vacancy fell sharply for the second consecutive quarter due to the removal of obsolete stock and the conversion of older commercial buildings into residential units. Despite this, the overall vacancy rate remained flat across Europe for Q2 skewed by a large volume of new office completions in core Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets which are yet to be occupied. For example, office stock is forecast to grow by at least 10% in Prague, Warsaw, Moscow and St Petersburg over the next 18 months, a large percentage of which is being built on a speculative basis. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The knock-on-effect of office vacancy declines, particularly in Western Europe, is likely to put upward pressure on prime rents in the longer term. Madrid, for example, has seen its prime rent increase from &amp;euro;24.50/sq m per month to €24.75/sq m per month in Q2, its first rental growth since the recession, symbolic of improved economic stability. The strongest performing office markets continue to see the steepest rises in prime rents, Dublin saw rents rise by a huge 14.2% in Q2 to €430.50/sq m per annum driven, in part, by strong demand from Technology, Media and Telecoms occupiers. London’s West End market recorded a 2.4% increase in rental growth across the same period.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Moscow demand remains under pressure of the geopolitical and related economic uncertainty. Q2 2014 take up activity was just &amp;frac14; of that, observed in the respective period of 2013. For the whole 2014th decline in demand might be as large as 25-40% compared to 2013. In this situation vacancy indicates upward trends, while rental rates feel themselves under pressure. By the end of the year vacancy might climb up to 16%, including 26% in class A.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Tim Hamilton, Senior Director, EMEA Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP explains:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We are seeing greater corporate appetite to lease or acquire space, particularly across Western Europe, which is encouraging. It signifies that corporate occupiers who have been hamstrung in recent years by tightening budgets and stringent cost management strategies resulting in a contraction of take-up levels, are now in a position to flex their muscles and take new space. As the markets become more buoyant, the growth in prime office rents is likely to become more widespread over the next 12 months particularly given the short supply and a relatively thin office development pipeline. Having spent a number of years taking advantage of falling rents, occupiers will need to start factoring in potential future rental increases into their strategic decision making.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The probability of drop in demand for office space by more than 20-25% in 2013 grows, as one has less and less time for de-escalation of current geopolitical problems. In this regard, we might see continuation of fast growth in vacancy in Q3. Moreover, it might be much higher than expected earlier due to further escalation of geopolitical problems and “war of sanctions”. However, we remain quite optimistic about 2015th , when we might see a recovery of demand in all segments of CRE market. According to our estimates, this recovery might start at the end of Q1 2015.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 30 September, 2014 &amp;ndash; Global real estate advisor CORE.XP analysed Russian regional industrial and logistics (I&amp;amp;amp;L) property market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Significant trends for I&amp;amp;amp;L market in the Russian regions include: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In H1 2014 the total stock in the regions (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg markets) amounted to 2.9 mln. sq m. By the end of the year this figure will reach 3.5 mln. sq m. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up in the regions in H1 2014 was double the same period of the previous year, reaching 217,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Markets in the regions are characterized by a high proportion of direct deals between the developer and the tenant or purchaser; this proportion can represent 30% to 90% of local absorption.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Depending on the region, 30-50% of the total stock is related to so-called &amp;amp;quot;off market&amp;amp;quot; projects that were initially built for end-user purposes before 2008; they do not affect the market, and are therefore not considered in this analysis (except for newly built projects). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In terms of level of market development, cities in Russia can be conditionally divided into 4 groups:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Moscow and St. Petersburg markets, which have already reached the initial stages of saturation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
     &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The actively growing markets of Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Samara, which have high potential for development and are close to the initial saturation stage.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
     &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The growing markets of Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Chelyabinsk and Voronezh.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
     &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Under-developed markets in other cities, where the low level of development was primarily due to low demand for quality space, and individual projects were constructed for the end-user. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
     &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prime rental rates for projects in the regions are $120/sq m/year, with average rents standing at $100/sq m/year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Moscow Region accounts for the largest share of the total nationwide stock of quality I&amp;amp;amp;L property, representing 62% of the market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In terms of total supply the most developed regional markets are in the cities that can be characterized as major transport hubs, facilitating high retail and wholesale turnover across large areas. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The significant imbalance between the amount of space in the capital markets (Moscow and St. Petersburg) and the regions is a result of the different stages of market development.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The first wave of construction in key regional cities (Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan) occurred in 2006-2007, when individual quality projects were being developed, mainly as &amp;amp;quot;built-to-suit&amp;amp;quot; schemes. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Demand. 217,000 sq m of warehouse space was leased or sold in H1 2014 on regional markets, which is double the result of the same period in 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Compared with the Moscow Region and St. Petersburg, regional markets are characterized by a higher share of direct deals in total leasing activity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Whereas about 90% of deals in Moscow and St. Petersburg take place with the involvement of consultants, in the regions this figure may be significantly lower. For example, in Samara (third largest stock in the regions) direct deals account for 90% of total leasing activity. This is mainly a result of the specific business practices of regional developers. FMCG companies were the most active takers of warehouse space during the last two years. They accounted for 55% of total absorption in H1 2014. The largest deals were by retail companies Holyday Classic and Lenta.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;New delivery. During H1 2014 a total of 153,000 sq m I&amp;amp;amp;L space was delivered. The largest projects were &amp;amp;quot;Logocenter&amp;amp;quot; in Chelyabinsk (60,000 sq m) and IP KENON in Chita (65,000 sq m).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most developed regions (in terms of total size of stock) are Novosibirsk (610,000 sq m), Yekaterinburg (559,000 sq m), Samara (330,000 sq m) and Kazan (201,000 sq m). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The total of 979,000 sq m of warehouse space is expected to be delivered in regional markets in 2014-2015, 492,000 sq m of which is to be commissioned by the end of this year (according to developers' announcements). In H1 2014 the total stock in the regions (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg markets) amounted to 2.9 mln. sq m. By the end of the year this figure will reach 3.5 mln. sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Vacancy rates depend directly on the size of the local market. On the most developed markets (Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Samara, Voronezh), vacant space does not exceed 3-4% of the total stock. In a number of cities which only have a single project, the vacancy rate sometimes reaches 50% (but in absolute terms, this might not be more than 10-15,000 sq m of immediately available space).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The average differential in rents between projects in the regions depends more on the quality of the project and the professionalism of the developer than on the city where the project is located.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Completed buildings and buildings close to completion are offered at rental rates ranging from $120 to $135 per sq m per year. The range of asking rents for class B warehouses is $90-100 per sq m per year. The average base rent in the regions is $100 per sq m per year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;It is quite typical for rents in the regions to be quoted on a gross rouble basis (with operating expenses already included). Average gross rouble rental rates amount to RUR 400 per sq m per month.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Oxana Fedulova, Senior Consultant, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The deficit of quality I&amp;amp;amp;L space in Russian regions is normal for the majority of the regional markets. This reflects the lack of the segment as a mature market. In the majority of regional cities I&amp;amp;amp;L stock is represented by single and in the most cases built-to-suit projects. At the same time retail property penetration and the level of development of wholesale with warehouses is on a very low level. But this is not a negative factor as for the majority of local regional businesses Class A and B warehouses are not effective&amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Major trends of the Moscow office market in Q3 2014:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;496,000 sq m was commissioned. This is a record-breaking volume of new supply in comparison to 2008:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Class A constitutes more than half of new delivery: Vodny, Lotos, Comcity, Romanov Dvor III, Dominion Tower&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The increase in the take-up volume by 175% compared to Q2 up to 231,800 sq m&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Class B accounted for 80% of the total take-up, 20% fall on class A&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian companies are the major tenants, representing 84% of the total take-up.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The highest demand is for office blocks less than 1,000 sq m, 74% of the total number of deals&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Following the trend of Q2 most of the take-up is concentrated in the central part of the city: inside the Third Transport Ring (56%). At the same time the major part of new delivery (85% of the total new supply) is beyond the Third Transport Ring&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The vacancy rate increased from 14.5% to 15.1%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Class B vacancy rate grew from 12% to 12.3%, Class A rate went up from 24% to 24.5%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The rental rates are still under the influence of high volume of new supply that would have caused the rise of vacancy rate regardless of demand fluctuations as well as geopolitical problems shaping the negative macroeconomic environment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The most significant fall in rental rates is observed in class B segment. It is attributed to the fact that the asking rental rate is often stated in rubles, and there was acknowledged a significant depreciation of the ruble relative to the dollar in Q3&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;During the first three quarters of 2014 the total take-up was 530,000 sq m (37% lower than the equivalent period of 2013). Q3 take-up volume reached 231,000 sq m, of which 45,900 sq m (20%) are Class A premises and 185,900 sq m (80%) - Class B. Despite the fact that Q3 is traditionally characterized by lower business activity due to the summer holiday season, quarterly results show more promise than Q2: increase by 175%. Such a significant upsurge is mainly attributed to the lowest take-up volume in Q2.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The volume of transactions in Q3 corresponds to quarterly figures of 2011-2013:  2011 – 260,900 sq m, 2012 – 203,000 sq m and 2013 – 291,500 sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The total take-up volume in Class A segment is 45,900 sq m (20%), which is 15,000 sq m more than in Q2. Typically, Class A premises are more vulnerable in terms of take-up during a crisis. Current uncertain situation pressures Class A tenants to remain in the premises they already occupy and renew leases.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most significant transaction in Q3 is Oracle lease at Comcity of 6,300 sq m. The transaction spotlights current decentralization and cost saving trends. It is worth mentioning that this is the only transaction in Class A segment beyond MKAD in Q3.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Large proportion of offices in Class A segment was leased by Russian companies: 27,000 sq m, international – 18,900 sq m. Certainly, in current market situation, international companies are more cautious in their further expansion in Russia. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Offices in Class B segment traditionally comprise the largest portion in the total take-up volume - 80% (185,900 sq m). Russian companies accounted for the major share of transactions: 166,900 sq m, international: 19 000 sq m. The largest transaction was an office lease of 10,300 sq m on Partiyny Lane by REN TV.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In general, the market share of international companies in the total take-up volume in Q3, as in Q1 amounted to 16%, the share of Russian - 84% (in Q2 - 25% and 75%, respectively).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Q3 deals as well as Q2 deals are localized primarily inside TTK (56%), 26% of which are the inside CBD and 30% – between the Garden Ring and Third Transport Ring, followed by area between the Third Transport Ring and MKAD – 34% and area beyond the MKAD – 10%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A distinctive feature of the demand in Q3 is 8 new lease transactions that involved area of more than 4,000 sq m. However, even considering this positive trend, office area less than 1,000 sq m remained the most popular among tenants, 74% of the total number of lease transactions.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q3 2014 the total of 496,000 sq m office space was put into operation, of which Class A accounted for 53% (263,600 sq m), Class B – 47% (232,400 sq m). Overall new commissioning volume reached more than 1 million sq m (1,028,900 sq m) in Q1-Q3 2014, of which Class A accounted for 552,900 sq m (54%). For the first time in history such a large amount of Class A office space enters the market. Large share of Class A offices in new delivery indicates qualitative development of the office market. Tenants tend to request more from their offices, and developers on their own are ready to fulfill the requirements. In the entire history of the market the amount of Class A spaces has never exceeded 36%, in average it ranged from 20% to 30% of the total. By the results of 2014, in accordance with projects announced for Q4, the share of Class A may reach 53%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to results of the first three quarters of 2014, the total office stock in Moscow sums up to 15 mln sq m, 3.25 mln sq m (21%) of which is Class A stock.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q3 2014 total vacancy rate slightly increased from 14.5% in Q2 2014 to 15.1%. In Class A segment vacancy rate increased from 24% to 24.5%, in Class B segment – from 12% to 12.3%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q3 landlords were more willing to provide individual commercial terms than in H1. Landlords are ready to make considerable incentives to tenants, namely: prolongation of lease duration, in some cases they are ready to make fit-out at their expense and fix dollar exchange rate in lease agreements. It is worth mentioning that the latter is the exception rather than the rule, however, tenants increasingly raise the issue. In general, asking rental rates in Q3 2014 remained stable in comparison to the end of H1 2014: $1,050–$1,150 for Class A Prime, $650–$750 for Class A and $400–$450 for Class B. However, it should be noted that rental rates experience significant pressure and we do not exclude a decrease in asking rates in Q4 2014 – Q1 2015. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP forecast, the annual take-up may reach 800,000 sq m, volume of new delivery – 1.4 million sq m. In Q4 390,000 sq m of office space is expected to be delivered, 190,000 sq m of which are Class A premises.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/office_agency/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Office Agency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the main features of Q3 is the demand recovery in comparison to Q2 results. A number of large deals of more than 4,000 sq m were done in the market, additionally, we registered several transactions for centrally located offices. Certainly, part of Q3 take-up volume is deferred demand from Q2. Despite the low take-up level in Q2, tenants were very active in the market. It’s worth mentioning a separate group of tenants which often actively look for new premises at the “bottom&amp;rdquo; of the market for consolidation to get the efficient office space and to optimize the costs for lease. The typical requirement of such international and Russian companies is more than 10,000 sq m. Despite the large volume of new delivery, large tenants have a limited number of options (not more than 10% of the total number of available office buildings). Currently, renewals and renegotiations are also one of the major demand characteristics.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

Overall European investment increased 27% year-on-year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Poland’s real estate market continues to attract strong investment, with &amp;euro;1,781 million invested in the 9 months to end of September 2014.  However, limited availability of product in prime commercial real estate in Poland means investors are now looking more closely at The Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary, which have seen increases of 11%, 215% and 126% respectively.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investment into Russian commercial real estate has dropped significantly, down 45% in the nine months to the end of September 2014, due in no small part to socio and political issues. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Commenting on the preliminary results, Mike Atwell, head of CORE.XP CEE Capital Markets, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We have seen continued strong interest in commercial real estate across the region, apart from in Russia.  This has been driven by low interest rates and increased allocation towards the asset class.  Based on the deal pipeline we have seen, we believe the last quarter of the year will be strong.  We also see no signs of a slowdown in activity and anticipate a continued increase in investment volumes for 2015.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Europe, Ireland and Spain are close to record-breaking levels for commercial real estate investment as buyers search for value in non-core markets. European commercial real estate investment totalled €48.4 billion in Q3 2014 - a substantial 27% increase on Q3 2013 and 4% higher than the previous quarter.  For the year-to-date, total investment has reached €133 billion compared to €105 billion for the first three quarters of 2013, an uplift of 27%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The performance of Irish and Spanish CRE investment markets was particularly impressive in Q3 2014.  Ireland achieved its highest total ever this quarter with €1.6 billion, surpassing the previous high in Q3 2006 of €1.5 billion and in Spain, the €3.5 billion invested in Q3 2014 was the country’s second highest quarter on record.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/market_research/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, СBRE in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Russia witnesses another wave of reduction in the investment activity on the commercial real estate market. Investors are in active search of opportunities, but transactions are being closed much less often than desired. Commercial real estate market is expected to remain under pressure till, at least, the end of Q1 2015. After that the trend of recovery might start forming. Investors in the next 9 months will be able to find mid-term interesting investment opportunities in quality properties, temporarily suffering from declined demand.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moscow, 28 October, 2014 &amp;ndash; According to the latest research from CORE.XP, the key feature of the Moscow industrial and logistics market was the decreasing level of rental rates. Prime rental rates decreased from $135 and stand at $125-130/sq m/year (excluding VAT and operating expenses) compared to H1 2014. In some projects the rental rate could be as low as $110/sq m/year in Q4 2014. Though this will not become a mid-term trend as this rental level significantly affects developers yield.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over Q3 2014 market activity amounted to 250,000 sq m 20,000 sq m of which one was a renewal deal. Take-up rose to 230,000 sq m and was 61% up on the previous quarter. However, despite this increase, current take-up is still 20% lower than the average quarterly level in 2013. Take-up totaled 590,000 sq m during the first 9 months of 2014, which is 46% less than the same period of 2013. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;77% of Q3 transactions were leased, 23% were sale of BTS. 63% of total take-up in the quarter was in the Southern and South-East directions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest contribution on the demand side of the market was made by retailers, who accounted for 36% of total take-up in Q3 2014. Among the largest deals last quarter were: kids&amp;rsquo; goods retail chain `Gulliver` that leased 30,000 sq m in a newly built complex `Berezhki`; national retail toy chain `Begemot` that leased 20,000 sq m in the second-hand Springs Park warehouse complex and shoe shop chain Kari that leased 20,000 sq m in the completed &amp;lsquo;Britovo’ complex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;236,000 sq m of warehouse space was commissioned in Q3 2014, which is 25% lower than average quarterly completions last year and 40% lower than in Q2 2014. More than 966,000 sq m of warehouse space was delivered to the market during the last nine months, which is higher than the total for the whole of 2013.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;860,000 sq m is planned for delivery in Q4 2014. Delivery for the year will amount to 1.8 mln sq m, which will be an all-time record for the Moscow Region warehouse market. The total stock in the Moscow Region could reach 9 mln sq m.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;78% of the warehouse complexes delivered in Q3 have already been sold or were built for owner-occupation. The vast majority of warehouse space (70% of Q3 delivery) was commissioned in the southern direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The highest amount of space that was announced for Q4 2014 will be delivered in the northern direction, where 302,000 sq m is expected to be delivered. Only 17% of this warehouse space has currently been leased or sold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vacancy rate increased from 4.48% in Q2 to 5.37% in Q3. The vacancy rate may reach 8-11% by the end of the year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Commercial terms in Q3 2014 and rental rates were under the pressure of continuing uncertainty over exchange rates and pricing policies by some developers; as a result, the market saw a reduction in rental rates. The range of rental rates changed: the majority of asking rents for second-hand space fluctuated between $110 /sq m/year and $130 /sq m/year. Prime rents decreased by 5.5% compared to H1 2014 and stand at $125-130/sq m/year (excluding VAT and operating expenses). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Operating expenses fluctuate within the $32-40 /sq m/year range, average utility payments are stable in the range of $8-12 /sq m/year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CORE.XP Research experts expect downward pressure on rental rates in Q4 2014 though rents below $110 / sq m / year are not perceived as mid-term sustainable as it significantly affects developers yield so it will last for a short period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse and Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia comments:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;New delivery has started the process of price range for different projects: while the projects with better location keep the rental rates on the same level and do just minimal price corrections, the others are dumping. Nevertheless, the growing vacancy rate, that can reach 10% point by the end of the year, will affect the rental rates even more. This trend is determined by the marginal level of developers’ business and its continuation will reflect on growing risks for both developers and tenants. That’s why in mid-term we expect the rental rates to be in the range of $110-$130/sq m/year. In this regard for the first time in the current market tenants are recommended to search for interesting opportunities in the most highly effective projects and fix the most attractive commercial terms.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moscow, 30 October, 2014 &amp;ndash; According to the latest research from CORE.XP, the key feature of the Moscow Retail market was further decrease of consumer activity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the middle of Q2 2014, the average footfall in Moscow shopping malls began to show a negative trend. This has particularly affected large-scale shopping centres.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The decline in consumer activity has led to a shift in demand towards community and neighbourhood format shopping centres.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the same time there is a demand from new international chains. During Q3 2014, 11 new international brands opened their first stores in Moscow, which is the highest number this year. All in all, 29 new international chains entered the Moscow market in the first nine months of the year and 10 more new brands could enter the market by the end of this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This activity takes place in the environment when the players that are already present in the market slow down their business due to apprehension of negative influence of current geopolitical problems on customers demand. For example, the German sports clothing and shoe chains Adidas and Reebok plan to open 80 new stores in 2015 instead of the previously planned 150. American retailer Columbia also expects a possible reduction of exports to Russia. Moreover, American fast food chain Wendy&amp;rsquo;s announced plans to leave the Russian market by the end of the year. The main reason is the high level of competition. As a result of the worsened business indicators, the South Korean electronics chain Samsung has decided to close more than 20% of its existing stores in Russia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chain retailers are continuing to test new formats: TVOYO hypermarket was opened in SEC Mega Belaya Dacha in September; the first Adidas Home Court in an interactive format was introduced in SEC Metropolis; and LEGO announced its plans to equip existing stores with special interactive and learning areas for children.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Average vacancy rate in Moscow modern shopping malls in Q3 2014 accounted to 3.8%, according to the latest data from CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Four new shopping malls were delivered in Q3 2014: two of these were part of mixed used complexes (Vodny and MC), and there were two neighbourhood format malls – Bravo and Alfavit. In total, 75,500 sq m was delivered in Q3 bringing the total since the beginning of the year to 365,500 sq m which is a record high amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total stock of modern retail space in Moscow therefore reached 4,456,000 sq m or 367 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are currently 9 shopping malls under construction with an announced delivery date by the end of 2014; they represent a total gross leasable area of 612,000 sq m. According to CORE.XP forecast, there is a high probability that the majority of these projects will be introduced in 2015.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In the street retail market in Q3 2014 the vacancy rate grew up to 7% on average. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was an official launch of a gastronomic street in July – Romanov Alley - the first in Moscow.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vacancy rate in pedestrian streets is much lower than in the high streets in Moscow. The highest amount of available space is in Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Arbat Streets, and the lowest in Klimentovsky Lane and Nikolskaya Street. The redevelopment of Pyatnitskaya Street and Pokrovka Street is complete. This has resulted in average in 10-15% and in some cases a 20% increase in rental rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rental rates in pedestrian streets have not significantly changed in Q3 2014, except for Stoleshnikov Lane, the range of rental rates increased.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total quality stock in modern shopping malls in Russia currently amounts to 17.1 mln sq m.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Q3 2014, 3 new shopping malls and a new stage of an existing Planeta Krasnoyarsk SEC with a combined total leasable area of 193,000 sq m were completed in Russian cities (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg). 1 mln sq m of new modern retail space is announced to be delivered by the end of 2014. Overall there is around 3 mln sq m of modern retail space under construction in Russian cities (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total new delivery in 2014 in Russia (including Moscow and St. Petersburg) will amount to 1.4-1.5 mln sq m according to the latest data from CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Rogozhin, Managing director of Retail Department, CORE.XP in Russia comments:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;In the next couple of quarters retailers will suffer from the impact of the ongoing slowdown of business activity and sharp devaluation of the ruble, which occurred in Q3 2014. This problem will mostly affect players focused on imports. Thus, newly constructed retail schemes will experience an even greater slowdown of demand from tenants. Already established and popular shopping malls may also face increasing challenges, as profitability of tenants may go down. Average vacancy rate for the year may exceed 5%, and the competition between shopping centers will become more acute.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 7 November, 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP has reported on the range of factors, cementing London&amp;rsquo;s position as a prime residential destination alongside other key cities favoured by high net worth individuals, including; New York; Paris; Hong Kong; Sydney and Singapore. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Global Living Report published today by CORE.XP highlights how this demand, initially buoyed by overseas buyers, has seen a resurgence of domestic purchasers who now make up 52% of London’s prime residential market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; As London leads the way in average prime residential new-build prices, which has now reached &amp;pound;2,000 per sq ft, the world’s preeminent financial centre is closely followed by Hong Kong and New York where the average prices are £1,950 and £1,800 respectively. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The Capital has witnessed an increase in population of one million since 2004, with a continued widely reported lack of stock of new housing supply to meet demand. The Global Living Report highlights the ratio of house building to population increase across 12 other cities; currently London has the largest supply and demand imbalance, followed by Paris and Hong Kong. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jennet Siebrits, Head of Residential Research at CORE.XP, comments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;London has continued to be recognised as a truly international city, which attracts investors and tourists alike for its world-class business, culture and education offering. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, our research also recognised that as record numbers of domestic purchasers invest in prime central London, UK buyers are also increasingly active in overseas markets. Those most popular locations with wealthy ex-pats include Hong Kong and Dubai, as well as the numerous oil industry pockets all over the world. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As part of the Global Living Report, CORE.XP has demonstrated how the Emirates real estate market has one of the most diverse buyer profiles, with 133 separate nationalities investing in Q1, 2O14. This compares with 25 nationalities transacting via CORE.XP so far this year.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When compared with many other countries, CORE.XP identifies that the current UK property tax regime is relatively modest. However, the inflow of overseas buyers into prime central London, and the subsequent surge in values, has led to substantial political pressure to change this. Although there was clear uncertainty around the time of the changes to the Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) in 2013, affecting transactions over £2 million around the time of implementation, these measures were later absorbed into the market, with no lasting impact. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 10 November 2014 &amp;ndash; The majority of European shoppers (88%) want a good range of retailers and an inclusive shopping experience when deciding where to shop. Cleanliness, price and convenience remain the most important factors for all consumers, but the importance of a social experience whilst shopping, continues to be of significant focus for the younger shopper (18-24 year olds), according to the major new research from global property advisor CORE.XP. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Social media channels continue to influence the way consumers shop with women (36%), 18-24 year olds (40%) and high income shoppers (35%) being the largest users of social media to keep up with special offers and events compared to less than a third of men, the older generation and low income consumers. However, looking at the differences in the young consumer by countries, it is interesting to see that only 24% of consumers in Germany use social media compared to 60% in of the same age group in Romania and 62% in Turkey. Men and Women in Great Britain and Denmark are the least engaged when it comes to social media shopping. Young shoppers will also use a shopping centre app twice a month reflecting the need for shopping centres to become more appealing to tech savvy shoppers by investing in apps to tailor for the individual and make the shopping experience more personal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Peter Gold, Head of Cross-Border Retail, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;rdquo;The overall shopping experience can be crucial to the success or failure of many schemes across the world. As consumers become ever more demanding, shopping centre owners are increasingly having to invest in making their centres more &amp;lsquo;experiential&amp;rsquo; to boost footfall as well as the all-important dwell time. High quality dining options, entertainment, special events and play areas for kids and grown-ups are all becoming more commonplace.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In the new survey of 21,000 European consumers across 21 countries, entertainment facilities such as a cinema, bowling, free WIFI and a good place to meet friends proved to be a significant attraction factor, particularly to young consumers in Great Britain, Denmark and Norway, compared to the older generation. This social aspect also varies by gender with 70% of female shoppers in Great Britain saying that they expect a shopping destination to be a good place to meet friends whilst only 49% of men agreed. Women and young consumers share the same aspirations for their shopping trip as a social and leisure activity in line with those consumers in Southern Europe. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consumers also ranked the presence of good restaurants as another appealing factor when deciding where to shop and we believe this could help in prolonging the consumers shopping experience. Young consumers (18-24 year olds) in Great Britain (31%) and Ireland (36%) in particular, considered good restaurants either extremely or very important in a shopping destination compared to 21% of all consumers. Landlords need to focus on what shopping centres can offer in addition to pure retail sales and consider investing in facilities that young people consider important to ensure they get a long term return. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Natasha Patel, Associate Director EMEA Research, commented: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; ”As shopping becomes not just a necessity but much more of a social activity; landlords and retailers need to adapt to demand for more leisure offerings. The savvy shopper requires an integrated shopping experience and it’s important for landlords and retailers to understand not only how to get consumers in the door but how to keep them in their centres or stores for longer. We can already see great examples of this through increased gastronomy in centres and concepts such as KidZania.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Analyst, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, commented on the results of the new report: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Retail property market in Russia has much shorter history than in Europe, especially in some regional cities. So shopping centers for Russian consumers have not yet become acknowledged places to meet friends and spend time. Therefore most respondents in Russia perceive shopping centers only as destinations for buying different goods. This is a great concern especially for owners of shopping centers in regional cities who rarely use modern methods of attracting visitors and influencing consumer perceptions. In this respect social media channels could become an effective means of attracting visitors. Also today there are very few examples of using shopping center App by Russian consumers – 65% of respondents never use them, but rapid growth of smartphone users could improve situation.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Countries included in the survey: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New energy sources supporting real estate demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cities surveyed for the purposes of this report: Aberdeen, Abu Dhabi, Accra, Almaty , Baku, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Calgary, Caracas, Denver, Dubai, Edmonton, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Houston, Jakarta, Lagos, London, Luanda, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Paris, Perth, Pittsburgh, Port Harcourt, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Stavanger, Takoradi, UK South East.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 11 November 2014 &amp;ndash; Average prime office rental growth is up by a quarter, at 25.2%, for energy dependent cities - a city which is driven by the energy sector (oil and gas) for economic and real estate activity - this year. This far outstrips the average of 4.5% for other established office locations according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP, which covers 33 cities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The respective growth, and real acceleration for energy dependent cities, is part of a global shift towards energy demand moving away from OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to non-OECD countries. Emerging markets, particularly China, India and parts of Africa and the Middle East, are leading such demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In addition, global energy consumption has risen by 2.3% this year, with 80% of the increase attributed to non-OECD countries. China, for example, is expected to become the world&amp;rsquo;s largest oil importer and India is set to become the largest coal importer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Such acceleration of energy production in non-OECD countries has led to steep increases in demand for good quality office space. Cities like Caracas, Jakarta and Baku are among the locations experiencing increased demand from energy companies which is forcing rental values up due to a lack of available good quality office stock. Caracas, Venezuela a city heavily invested in the energy sector, has seen prime office rents increase by 280% y-o-y, although this is also influenced by limited office development, high inflation and uncertain political conditions; Jakarta, Indonesia has increased by 42% while Baku, the energy focused capital of Azerbaijan, has picked up by 17.6%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Luanda, the capital of Angola, is the second biggest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa with energy sector occupiers accounting for a substantial portion of the market. Although rents have eased slightly over the past year, low supply and ongoing demand mean that the prime rent is $178 per sq ft pa, ranks it fourth of the cities surveyed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Armstrong, Director, EMEA Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Energy markets continue to evolve at a rapid pace and the landscape is expected to undergo fundamental and lasting changes over the next 20 years. Energy supply is coming from a greater range of locations with such diversification effecting companies’ operational decisions and causing substantial impact on office markets. This is particularly the case in some emerging markets where there is limited office stock and high demand for space from energy sector companies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“A year ago, on average energy dependent cities were up by 10.6% y-o-y compared to established business centres at 2.9%. The jump in growth to 25% signifies the upward rental trend of energy dependent markets.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Iain Landsman, Associate Director, at CORE.XP, added: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; “In established markets, energy companies are increasingly using commercial property to attract and retain the best talent in a highly competitive sector. This has led to a number of companies consolidating or relocating to new bespoke headquarters.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research, at CORE.XP said: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Unlike other markets, oil and gas demand for office space is not critical for the dynamics of vacancy rates and rent. In recent years, the volume of transactions concluded by companies from this sector, represented 6% in 2012 and 10% in 2013. Sector’s activity in 2014 is expected to fluctuate around 7% of all office lease and sale transactions. However, if Transneft completes the acquisition of Evolution tower in Moscow-City by the end of the quarter, the share of energy sector could reach 17% of the total market activity. In this case, Transneft may stabilize the situation in Moscow-City, where current vacancy exceeds 35%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Purchasing activity of the sector is sufficiently significant. Major representatives often prefer to purchase offices rather than rent. Usually, the rental activity of oil and gas segment is converged around Class A and B+ in the center and south-east of the capital, due to “attraction” of the largest energy companies: for example Gazprom headquarters. Currently the Moscow office market is under tension due to increasing vacancy coinciding with lower leasing activity related to geopolitical events. This trend is likely to continue through the early 2015, granting tenants and buyers opportunity to benefit from lower rates in the mid-term. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given that the oil and gas sector is export-oriented, and the ruble has shown a very strong decline in 2014. Activity of this group of tenants in 2015 is expected to be high enough regardless of 25% drop in oil prices.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, November 13, 2014 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, the global real estate advisor, announces research study for large office complexes located beyond the MKAD and business parks in Moscow.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The history of the first business parks in Europe started in the mid-80s in Great Britain, to the west of London. The first tenants were fast-developing IT companies. It is important to mention that most of those tenants were from the USA and were used to such format: in the USA the rise of business parks was noted in the 60s. Eastern Europe followed the trend: in the late 1990s business parks were actively developed in Poland and the Czech Republic.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Traditionally, business parks are located quite far from the city centre, along main highways, and usually close to airports. A business park should also have very good transport access.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The first business park in Moscow developed in accordance with the traditional business park concept was Krylatsky Hills buisnes park (17 Krylatskaya Street). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The business park was put into operation in H2 2005–H1 2006. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Due to the fact that the developer was the first to implement such a project, he was able to attract the largest business park tenants.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The key to the success of the project is the tenants who moved outside the MKAD busting stereotypes. International companies were &amp;ldquo;psychologically&amp;rdquo; ready to move from the centre of the city, as their headquarters in Europe and the US are generally located in business parks outside the city centre.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Almost six years later, in 2011, the second landmark business park was put into operation – Olympia Park at 39 Leningradsky Highway. The first office building outside the MKAD – Country Park – was put into operation at the end of 2003.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The tenants of decentralised offices are mainly large companies, both Russian and international. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP analysed the tenant mix of class A and B+ office complexes outside the MKAD (the total area researched was 133,000 sq m). International companies occupy 30% less space than Russian companies (55,000 sq m and 78,000 sq m respectively). However, there are twice as many international as Russian companies (33 and 18 respectively). Therefore, beyond the MKAD offices of large Russian companies occupy an average area of 4,300 sq m, while international companies - 1,600 sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP forecasts that in 2015 IT and telecommunications companies will dominate in terms of area leased as a result of Rostelecom (50,000 sq m), Systematica (17,000 sq m) and Oracle (6,400 sq m) moving to Comcity. The share of IT and telecommunications companies will therefore reach almost 50%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP research, a number of world business parks are tending to be industry specific (e.g. in London, Prague, Warsaw, and Dubai). Business parks in Moscow may also become industry-oriented in the future.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Delivery in 2014–2015 is likely to beat the record of 2007–2008 by 30%. Total delivery in 2014–2015 will reach 400,000 sq m of which 60% will be put into operation in 2014.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;About 200,000 sq m has been announced to be delivered in the next 2 years in New Moscow. This includes projects such as K2, Neopolis, Comcity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Obviously a large amount of new delivery in one period of time will inevitably lead to a high level of competition on the supply side. Determining factors for tenants when leasing an office outside the MKAD will be a business park&amp;rsquo;s design, variety of infrastructure, convenience of driveways and availability of public transport, effective parking ratio, rental rate and an opportunity to lease larger areas (offices leased outside the MKAD can be several times larger than those inside the MKAD within the same rental budget).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The average class A and B+ office rental rate outside the MKAD is $300–450, and inside - $500–750. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Head of Office Agency, comments:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The active development of business parks we are witnessing now finally makes it possible for office tenants to accomplish the long-awaited consolidation projects and increase efficiency. It is also the right relocation rationale to secure an attractive rental value with no compromise to quality, to the contrary improving it substantially. Notwithstanding the fact that international tenants pioneer decentralization, we are experiencing a great level of interest to K2 Business Park from major Russian firms&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Cafetera will take more than 1 000 sq m in the second phase of the project (building B). The lease agreement term is more than 5 years. Transaction was brokered by CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Cafetera is a retail network of modern self-service cafeterias for Class A and A + business centers. The operator offers visitors a fresh daily menu with a selection of soups, main courses, salads, sandwiches, desserts and pastries. Bespoke design is another highlight of Cafetera. Interiors, which were designed by the well-known interior design studio, organically fit into the overall concept and the architectural design of K2, which was created by NBBJ. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Olga Korobeinikova, Project Manager of K2, noted: &amp;ldquo;Cafetera adheres to the design concepts of K2 which provide a comfortable and prestigious location for business development. The high quality cuisine and service, as well as reasonable prices will allow the tenants of K2 not only to have breakfast and lunch in a welcoming atmosphere without leaving the business center, but also for various events: conferences, business meetings, corporate events, etc.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;K2 Business Park is the first international class A business park in the territory of New Moscow and adheres to the highest international standards. K2 consists of four seven-story office buildings with a leasable area of approximately 18,500 each.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Total leasable area of the project is approximately 74,000 sq m. In accordance with the construction schedule, the first phase will be put in operation already in the Q4 2014. Full completion of all four phases is scheduled for Q4 2015. The K2 Business Park has earned the title of the most sustainable office project in Russia by receiving the Excellent rating in accordance to the international assessment methodology BREEAM, as well as the prestigious title at Green Awards 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Strong Investor Sentiment Drives Further Price Increases&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 20 November 2014 &amp;ndash; European retail investment reached &amp;euro;33 billion in the first nine months of the year, the highest total for this period since 2007, according to the latest research from CORE.XP.  For Q3 alone, investment volumes reached €11.1 billion, a 23% increase on turnover for the same quarter in 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The UK and the Iberia region have seen the strongest increase in retail investment activity so far this year. The UK recorded its highest retail investment level since 2007, with €12.2 billion transactions completed in the first nine months. Investment in Spanish retail was equally strong with €1.6 billion transacted in Q3, the highest quarterly total since 2007.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investor sentiment is also improving for retail properties in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), despite the current political situation and following two quarters of relatively muted activity. Romania saw one of CEE&amp;rsquo;s largest retail deals in Q3 2014; the Immochan acquisition of a €261 million retail portfolio. Russia also saw an uptick in investment over the same period, albeit from a very low base.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Investor interest in retail, across most of Europe, continues to strengthen and there has been a notable increase in the type and nationality of the investors. This, in turn, is generating further growth in competition. As a result, the CORE.XP EU-28 High Street and Shopping Centre Yield Indices reported significant quarterly compressions at 11bps and 13 bps respectively, for the quarter. Average weighted prime yields now stand at 4.42% for high street and 5.28% for shopping centres, their keenest since Q3 2007 (4.41%) and Q2 2008 (5.13%), respectively. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;John Welham, Head of European Retail Investment at CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We have a wider range of investors from more countries targeting retail investment in Europe than even before the global financial crisis. Most investors are using low levels of debt, if any, but we do see loan to values in transactions gradually increasing. In all likelihood the amount of capital - debt and equity - targeting European retail investment will soon exceed 2007 levels. This is putting increased downward pressure on yields.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Iryna Pylypchuk, Director of EMEA Research and Consulting, CORE.XP added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“So far this year we have seen strong investor sentiment towards European retail and a growing investor pool, which is translating into a notable increase of international capital flows targeting the sector, as well as a steady stream of larger deals. With that in mind we expect strong investor competition to continue in Q4, with significant prospects of further yield compression and possibly a record high in terms of European retail investment market activity.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anna Melnik, Head of Capital Markets Research, Research department, CORE.XP, Russia:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Despite all government’s efforts Russian economy continues approaching recession under the influence of Western sanctions, rouble depreciation, oil prices decrease and tightened lending conditions. Definitely, all these factors have a negative impact on the attractiveness of Russian assets. The retail segment was one of the first to be at risk. In the previous years, investment in this sector accounted for 20-40% of the total, and traditionally it was on the 2nd place among other commercial real estate segments. In the first 9 months of 2014 the retail sector is on the 4th place with a total investment of USD 200 mln, or 6% of total volume. The main concerns are related to the large amount of new delivery in 2014-2015 and increasing pressure on rental rates. Nevertheless, investments in quality, income generating properties in this sector are seen as one of the most secure at the moment”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow - London &amp;mdash; December 17, 2014 —Hong Kong, New York, Paris, London and Tokyo retained their positions as the world&amp;rsquo;s most expensive high-street retail destinations in Q3 2014, according to new research from global property advisor CORE.XP Group, Inc.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP’s quarterly ranking of the world’s prime global retail markets saw little change in Q3 2014, with global and hot-growth markets continuing to lead the list. Retailers across all markets continue to target high-end shopping areas and international tourists. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Even with the somewhat gloomy economic headlines, consumer demand is reasonably firm in most markets,&amp;rdquo; said Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist, CORE.XP. “We can expect to see a continuation of the post-crisis pattern of periods of optimism followed by periods of pessimism. The Americas will see stronger growth than the Eurozone, as the latter has been constrained by restructuring in the banking sector as well as overly tight fiscal and monetary policy. Asia Pacific will record slightly lower growth in 2014 over 2013, but is still expected to outpace the other two regions by a considerable margin.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hong Kong (US$4,327 per sq. ft. per annum) maintained a wide lead over the number-two market, New York (US$3,570 per sq. ft. per annum)—where prime rent along Fifth Avenue is at record levels. Rents in Hong Kong remained stable compared to Q2 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The “Occupy Central” protest, which began late in the third quarter, has not yet materially impacted retail rents in Hong Kong,” said Henry Chin, Head of Research, Asia Pacific, CORE.XP. “We did see lower shopper footfall in affected areas in October; however, the Christmas shopping season will provide some support to retail sales in the final quarter.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A large rental spread also exists between New York and the two leading European markets: Paris (US$1,331per sq. ft. per annum) and London (US$1,328 per sq. ft. per annum). The gap between the top four markets and the rest of the top 10 widens significantly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While the top four cities continue to hold their leading positions, there was some movement lower in the top 10 rankings. Rents rose in Tokyo (US$1,076 per sq. ft. per annum), and fell in Zurich ($895 per sq. ft. per annum) and Sydney (US$730 per sq. ft. per annum), resulting in the cities changing positions this quarter. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q3 2014, Tokyo continued to lead rental growth in Asia Pacific, with the continued lack of space in major high-street retail locations pushing up retail rents 7.7 percent quarter-over-quarter. Strong rental growth was also recorded in a number of emerging markets in the region, particularly in India and Vietnam, reflecting the recent resumption of structural economic reforms following the general lack of progress over the past few years. Highlights included a strong 5.9 percent quarter-over-quarter rental growth in Ho Chi Minh City and a 4.0% quarter-over-quarter rental growth in Mumbai.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Retailer demand for prime locations in major cities across EMEA remained firm, but rental growth has tailed off, leaving most markets flat in Q3 2014. Hamburg (up 6.5 percent quarter-over-quarter) and Munich (up 5.6 percent quarter-over-quarter) were among the few markets to record growth, reflecting the fact that, despite the recent economic headlines, domestic consumption in Germany remains firm.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Andrew Phipps, Head of EMEA Retail Research and Consulting, CORE.XP said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Strong international demand for prime locations in major cities across Europe has remained firm.  London and Paris are seeing continuing demand from retailers looking for flagship stores or further expansion opportunities in these proven markets.  Luxury retailers have continued to drive demand as they compete for the most coveted shopping destinations, exerting upward pressure on prime rental in the best shopping locations.  The belief that both local and overseas visitors will continue to spend on luxury items in the right locations will ensure the most attractive sites remain a key focus for retailers as we move through 2015.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the U.S., four of the 12 prime retail corridors tracked by CORE.XP Research saw quarter-over-quarter increases in prime rents during Q3 2014. Prime asking rents along Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles (US$640 per sq. ft. per annum) continue to be the highest in the U.S. outside of Manhattan, and are expected to record further increases over the remainder of 2014, as there continues to be a lack of available space. Miami (up 3.2 percent quarter-over-quarter), Washington, D.C. (up 2.2 percent quarter-over-quarter), and New York (up 2.0 percent quarter-over-quarter) also reported increasing in prime asking rents in Q3 2014. In Canada, high-street rents were unchanged in Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto, and have remained at their current level since Q4 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director, Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Prime rent for Moscow retail destinations started declining since the beginning of 2014. Cumulative decrease by the end of Q3 amounted to 25%: from 8,000 to 6,000 USD/sqm/year. To large extent this situation is caused by a large supply of new quality shopping centers, increased competition from the pedestrian streets and the negative impact of the ruble devaluation on the retailers&amp;acute; P&amp;amp;amp;Ls. Under influence of these conditions the owners of retail premises became more flexible. This fact contributed into vacancy rate, indicating comparatively slower growth up to 7-8%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Due to the current ruble devaluation rate Moscow is very likely to leave the top ten most expensive retail destinations in the world. It might occur already in Q1 2015. On the other hand, current situation is expected to generate even better commercial terms and opportunities for the new entrants.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow - Los Angeles &amp;mdash; December 23, 2014 — London&amp;rsquo;s West End remained the world’s highest-priced office market but Asia continued to dominate the world’s most expensive office locations, accounting for three of the top five markets, according to CORE.XP Research’s semi-annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs survey. The study also found that prime rents are rising fastest in the Americas, where real estate fundamentals continue to improve. Overall, the U.S. accounted for five of the 10 markets with the fastest growing prime occupancy costs. These markets were Seattle (Suburban), San Francisco (Peninsula), Boston (Suburban), San Francisco (Downtown) and Seattle (Downtown). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London West End’s overall prime occupancy costs of US$274 per sq. ft. per year topped the &amp;ldquo;most expensive&amp;rdquo; list. Hong Kong (Central) followed with total prime occupancy costs of US$251 per sq. ft., Beijing (Finance Street) (US$198 per sq. ft.), Beijing (Central Business District (CBD)) (US$189 per sq. ft.) and Moscow (US$165 per sq. ft.) rounded out the top five. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The change in prime office occupancy costs mirrored the gradual, multi-speed recovery of the global economy. Global prime office occupancy costs rose 2.5 percent year-over-year, led by the Americas (up 4.1 percent) and Asia Pacific (up 2.8 percent). Meanwhile, EMEA was essentially flat, edging up 0.3 percent year-over-year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“We expect the gradual recovery of the global economy to continue, leading to better hiring rates and further reduction in the availability of space across most markets over the near term,” said Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist, CORE.XP. “In this environment, we expect occupancy costs to continue rising from current levels, further limiting options for occupiers. Technology, quality and flexibility are expected to increasingly come into consideration in space use and location decisions, as occupiers will seek to contain costs and improve productivity.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP tracks occupancy costs for prime office space in 126 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 20 were in EMEA, 20 were in Asia Pacific and 10 were in the Americas. &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;Apple-tab-span&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;white-space: pre;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;	&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Eurozone’s tepid economic recovery has held back occupier activity, resulting in static prime occupancy costs in most core European markets. The region’s 0.3 percent year-over-year increase in prime occupancy costs was primarily driven by buoyant conditions in U.K. cities, most Nordic markets, and the strong recovery of the Dublin office market. The main decreases have been in central European markets, such as Warsaw (down 1.6 percent), where the economies are relatively healthy but new supply has driven down rents. In only a few markets, notably Dublin (up 34.9 percent) and London, a robust recovery in occupier demand coincided with a lack of new supply.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In addition to London West End, other markets from the region on the global top 10 list were Moscow (US$165 per sq. ft.) and London City (US$153 per sq. ft.). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Asia Pacific had 20 markets ranked in the top 50 most expensive, including seven of the top 10—Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Beijing (CBD), New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD), Hong Kong (West Kowloon), Tokyo (Marunouchi Otemachi) and Shanghai (Pudong). Occupier activity in the region was largely driven by domestic corporations and companies in the technology, media and telecommunications sectors. Half the markets saw costs increase above 1 percent.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hong Kong (Central) remained the only market in the world—other than London’s West End—with a prime occupancy cost exceeding $200 per sq. ft. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$99 per sq. ft.), in 19th place. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the U.S., where the economic recovery has firmly taken hold, strong leasing activity led to the highest level of quarterly net absorption since 2007, driving above-inflation increases in prime occupancy costs across all but one major U.S. market. Additionally, increasingly broad-based rising hiring rates have boosted demand for office space. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Eight North American markets recorded double-digit increases in prime occupancy costs in Q3 2014, and the top six growth markets in the Americas were all U.S. cities.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;New York Midtown, the 11th most expensive market in the world, remained the most expensive Americas market, with a prime office occupancy cost of US$121 per sq. ft.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rio de Janeiro remained the most expensive market in Latin America, posting an office occupancy cost of US$101 per sq. ft. and ranking as the 18th most expensive market globally. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Claudia Chistova, Head of Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In Q4 2014 Moscow rents significantly decreased despite the high occupancy costs for prime office space in Moscow in Q3. In current situation, Moscow will not take the 5th place. In H1 2015 we expect to observe further rents decrease. On average, the rents went down by 10-20% in Q4. However, the 2nd half of December changed the situation dramatically due to the sharp ruble depreciation. Tenants are not ready to pay the rent at Central Bank rate and developers meet the requirement and fix the rents in currency units at the level of 50 -55 rubles (as a rule). Currently, the asking rate for Prime A office space is around $950 per sq m/ year net of service charges and VAT. However, the highest rents are still asked for the premises located in the Kremlin area, $1,100 &amp;ndash; $1,200. According to our estimations, in 2015 the rents will continue to decrease by 10%.     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Plus to rents decrease, developers are ready to give additional incentives to tenants such as extension of rental holidays, including fit-out at their expense. Some developers nominate the rent in rubles. In case of further development of uncertainty in econoy the shift to the fixing rents in currency units even for Prime A space will become obvious.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow &amp;ndash; January 16, 2015 &amp;mdash; Companies are increasingly prioritising employee needs when making business and real estate decisions, according to the latest annual European Occupier Survey by global real estate advisor, CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The survey, now in its fifth year, polls real estate decision makers at global corporations collectively occupying approximately 200 million sq m worldwide to understand their objectives and associated challenges across a broad range of issues. The respondents represent companies headquartered primarily in Western Europe or North America spanning multiple sectors, of which the largest are: banking and finance, professional services, and technology and telecommunications.     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The importance of an effective workplace strategy that prioritises staff needs has risen up the agenda. This is a shift from the start of the economic downturn when cost was the core strategy driver, which created a potential disconnect between companies and their employees. Today, companies acknowledge these factors cannot be managed in isolation as evidenced by a third of respondents (33%) citing labour and skill shortages as a key business challenge, up from 21% last year. In addition, the workforce featured heavily as an explanation for companies&amp;rsquo; location decision-making.  For example, approximately half of the respondents (46%) cited talent availability as a key factor behind location decisions, while 30% highlighted the cost of labour as a key driver.  Both responses were 10% higher than the corresponding figures last year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a result, interest in adopting workplace strategies continues to gain momentum. Of those surveyed, two thirds (67%) reported that their workplace strategy was primarily driven by the need to attract and retain talent. This represents a 20% increase from last year (48%) and dislodges cost savings from the top spot (56% in 2013 to 43% today) into third place as the principal aim of such a programme. The second most popular reason to implement a workplace strategy was the desire to increase employee productivity (46%), up from 37% last year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In addition, amenity rich locations that provide quality space and transport accessibility are increasingly sought by companies with 65% stating these factors are vital for building selection and to attract the younger generation. This demonstrates the increasing importance placed on workforce satisfaction and its impact on decision-making. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, Senior Director - EMEA Research and Consulting, at CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Roll back two years and 70% of companies reported that the uncertain economic outlook in Europe was a key factor in their real estate strategy, with cost management being the primary objective. Today, this has somewhat abated with 50% identifying weak economies as a concern. Instead, attention has turned to the workforce. Location decisions are becoming more dependent on where labour is, or where it can be persuaded to move to, and building selection also increasingly reflects the importance of staff attraction and satisfaction. As a result, property decisions and employee aims are becoming increasingly aligned, with workplace and staff wellness high on the agenda.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Ian Entwisle, CEO - EMEA Global Corporate Services, at CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“A core feature of our results is the focus on workplace, space and people. Labour is the single largest expense for companies, so the impact of improving productivity through shrewd strategies can be material. Initiated intelligently, employee wellbeing and engagement can be enhanced, which will positively influence a company’s profitability, culture and brand.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mikhail Kaplun, Director of Project Management Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Sharp Ruble depreciation in 2014 and, especially, in December led to fast growth of office expenses for the majority of tenants.  Companies, oriented on the domestic market, feel themselves in the most vulnerable position, as their sales cannot growth with the same speed. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a result, workplace strategy quickly came to the agenda of a lot of companies, especially those, which cannot change commercial terms of their leasing agreements. Unlike in Europe, in Russia cost optimizations remains the key driver for Workplace strategies projects. We already register growing interest to this topic.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The question of effectiveness of using of office space was not as relevant for the major companies as it is right now. CORE.XP practice shows that the companies that leased their office 3 to 7 years ago have a potential to cut 20 to 50% of their current office space now. This is connected either with the right process of needs analysis or with the fact that company initially leased fitted out office space. In addition, the landlords today actively offer to provide fitting out by themselves or to include the expenses into the rental rate. As a result, there is a very good chance for those companies, for which cost savings is the key factor at the moment, to move into the new office with great fit-out, increase the quality of workplace and improve image of the company as an employer, saving on fit-out expenses, cutting the office space, based on the right needs analysis and smart office planning. According to CORE.XP practice, the use of workplace strategy can help to save up to 50% of office expenses and at the same time to introduce positive changes into the work progress.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Poland retained its leading position, with investment volume close to €3.1 billion for the 12 months to 31 December 2014, a similar level to that of the last four years. An additional €2.3 billion was traded in Russia, compared to €5.3 billion in 2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There was a marked increase in investment activity in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia with percentage growth figures of 71%, 220% and 72% respectively. The total of these three countries, €2.1billion, equates to over a quarter (27%) of total CEE volumes in 2014, compared to 15% in 2013. &#13;

Mike Atwell, Head of Capital Markets, CEE at CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The key change in CEE in 2014 was the marked increase in investment activity outside Poland, specifically in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. As new investors focus their sights on the region, the more opportunistic of these are placing their capital further afield, partly to generate higher income returns but also due to lack of available stock in Poland. We expect this trend to continue, with Hungary and Romania benefitting the most from this investor diversification.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jos Tromp, Head of Research &amp;amp;amp; Consulting, CEE &amp;amp;amp; Africa, CORE.XP added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Poland has seen incredibly stable investment volumes over the last four years, at around €3 billion per annum since 2011, and this looks set to continue. Interestingly, approximately just 20 major international investors make up the bulk of this activity, contributing to 90% of all Polish real estate investment last year – highlighting the importance of cross-border investment for the country. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Apart from the revival of the more peripheral investment markets in CEE, the second major trend is the drop in investment activity in Russia. Over the past few years, Russia has been fighting with Poland for pole position in the region, but the strong decrease in oil prices, currency losses and Ukrainian conflict have seen it rapidly fall away. What is uncertain is how and when this conflict may be resolved. However, a resolution is unlikely to result in a quick recovery of cross-border investment. Trust will have to be rebuilt to convince investors to come back and this could take some time.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Sector analysis shows that CEE offices remained the preferred asset class, with a 61% increase in investment, and the industrial sector saw investment volume rise by 39%. Retail investment was down 7%, due to a shortage of available stock in this sector – not a lack of interest. Investment in hotels increased 15%, confirming a renewed interest in the sector. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In 2014 investments in Russian commercial real estate shrank more than 2 times under the pressure of geopolitical problems and related instability of the financial market. Growing problems in economy had adversely influenced traditional investors&amp;rsquo; activity, including cross-border players. However, the interest to the market from “hunters from bargain deals” is steadily growing.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
With large probability 2015 will indicate even weaker results than in 2014 with expected volume of investment transactions at around USD 2.5 bn. Nevertheless, Russian commercial real estate market remains fundamentally attractive for investors. As soon as the current crisis is over, investment volumes could reach USD 7-9 bn. per annum.”&#13;

It is worth mentioning, that PNK Group’s properties are the only warehouse complexes in Russia boasting with these requirements. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At the moment the following renowned companies are tenants of PNK-Chekhov 2 &amp;ndash; world’s leading sport products manufacturer Adidas, food retailer Lenta, multichannel online-retailer Enter, clothing chain Lady&amp;amp;amp;Gentleman and wine house and retailer Abrau-Durso. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Oleg Mamaev, Executive Director, PNK Group: “Our market and the segment of high quality warehouse real estate are currently going through a very challenging period, which is evidently the best time for fundamental investments in infrastructure and increasing the efficiency of company’s warehouse logistics. Purchasing the high-quality effective warehouse, being the core of any kind of business, could be a good example of such investments. It is quite telling, that only PNK-Chekhov 2 has been selected among all the warehouse properties currently presented as the only one meeting all the criteria and benefits of modern A class.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP said : “This deal proves that warehouse market continue to actively grow, and economically stable companies that are focused on further business growth are ready to invest into high quality and liquid warehouse projects.”&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 28 January 2014 &amp;ndash; Investment in European commercial real estate (CRE) in the fourth quarter of 2014 reached its highest quarterly total since 2006, according to the latest research from CORE.XP. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Commercial real estate investment volumes reached &amp;euro;78 billion in Q4 2014, 49% higher than the previous quarter and 27% higher than the same period in 2013. For the year as a whole, the total value of CRE investment across the region was €218 billion, an uplift of 32% on 2013.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Nearly all Western European countries saw significantly higher investment activity in Q4 2014, than in the same quarter in 2013. Sweden and the Netherlands were particularly strong, with Q4 2014 turnover close to historic highs and up 97% and 89%, respectively, year-on-year. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Netherlands, which saw steady growth in investment activity throughout 2014, recorded nearly €4 billion of transactions in Q4 2014, bringing the total for the year to more than double that of 2013. Spain, Italy and Portugal also recorded very high levels of transactions in Q4 2014, with 65% of all the activity for the year in Portugal transacted in the final quarter. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Head of EMEA Capital Markets at CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;2014 saw the emergence of the more opportunistic investor, as many recognised the need to participate in the European recovery story. This was particularly evident in the final quarter of the year, with increased capital flows into markets that had been especially affected by the recent downturn such as the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Portugal.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
On an annual basis Sweden (€14.5 billion), Spain (€10.2 billion) and Ireland (€4.59 billion) recorded record levels of CRE investment. At €77 billion for the year, the United Kingdom was also within 10% of its previous record year - 2006.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Unsurprisingly, investment activity in Russia was relatively weak all year, with the total for Q4 2014 particularly low at just €238 million. Economic sanctions and the fall in the price of oil affected investor confidence, and total activity for the year was less than half the level in 2013 at €2.7 billion. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In 2014 Russia took just 15th place by volumes of investments in commercial real estate market. Just a year ago Russia was steadily approaching top-5 of the most attractive European markets. In 2015 under the influence of negative macroeconomic trends investment volumes might decrease by additional 30%, staying below EUR 2,5 bn. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nonetheless, in the long term Russia remains one of the largest European markets. After current problems are solved, investment activity might get back to EUR 5-6 bn. per annum and even higher.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Sharp Rouble depreciation and growth of inflation rate resulted in weakening of consumer demand, which become the main trend of retail market in 2014. According to Rosstat, the increase in the Consumer Price Index reached 11.4% in 2014 versus 6.5% in 2013. Inflation expectations for 2015 have also increased significantly and amount to 13-15%.
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
The total stock of modern retail space in Moscow reached 4.8 mln. sq m, or 396 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants and annual increase became the record high. In terms of penetration rate, Moscow has thus narrowed the gap with Western European capitals, where this figure varies from 450 to 600 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants.
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Technical openings of shopping malls, when the vacancy rate can be 30-40% or even higher, have become a rule in the Moscow retail property market. As a result, the average vacancy rate in Moscow reached 7% by the end of the year (in 2013 this indicator was 2.6%).
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
As a result of the macroeconomic factors mentioned above, many retailers have cut their development plans. At the end of the year, retailers such as Adidas, Incity, Media Markt, Samsung, Sportmaster and Stockmann announced the reduction of development plans. Moreover, holdings such as BNS Group, Inditex, LPP and Melon Fashion Group also announced the postponement of plans to open new stores.
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
In addition, at the end of 2014, Chevignon, Esprit, Gerry Webber, New Look, OVS, River Island, Sepalla and Wendy`s announced their exit from the market for different reasons. At the same time, the departure of international retailers will not be extensive, because Moscow is still a market with one of the highest purchasing powers in Europe.
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
44 new international retailers actually entered the Moscow market in 2014, which is the highest rate for all time.
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Demand for retail space from retailers will continue to decline. Thus, developers and owners of shopping malls will show increased interest in unusual tenants: for example, the return of special zones with individual entrepreneurs.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Important trends for the Moscow&amp;rsquo;s retail property market in 2015 are the flowing:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The stronger the competition becomes among large-scale shopping centres, the higher is the interest in neighbourhood malls, a niche which is still unsaturated. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The total amount of shopping malls that are currently under construction and can be delivered in 2015-2016 is 1.4 mln. sq m. However, current bank lending conditions and the upcoming recession in the Russian economy do not encourage the development of new projects&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Taking into account the high volume of new supply and the slowdown of retailers’ development plans, many new shopping malls will face difficulties with their occupancy rate. This means that owners will continue to use technical openings, when 30-40% of leasable space is vacant. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the amount of new supply in 2015 is comparable to 2014 and negative trends continue on the demand side, the vacancy rate could rise to 11% or even higher.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;11 new brands have announced that they plan to enter the Moscow market in 2015. These include retail chains such as Anta Sports, Bric’s, Kidzania, a Ferrari merchandise store and Popbar. Moreover, during 2015 the Italian clothes and footwear retail chain Twin Set plans to open 8 new stores, the DIY brand OBI plans to open 6 new hypermarkets, and Media Markt will open 5 stores.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;By the end of 2014, the vacancy rate in street retail had reached its highest level for the last 18 months, namely 8.2%. This figure could increase up to 12-15% in 2015. Pedestrian streets remain attractive for new and existing retail chains, hence the decrease in rental rates there was much more moderate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers are switching their interest from Moscow, St. Petersburg and some other major Russian cities to the less saturated cities with high purchasing power. The expected increase during 2015-2016 amounts to 700,000 sq m. Another important driver for the construction of new shopping malls is the relatively low level of competition (for example in cities such as Nizhnevartovsk, Noviy Urengoy and Noyabrsk). However, large cities continue to be rather attractive for the development of new shopping malls. The next wave of new construction will be in those cities with higher potential, such as Perm, Vladivostok, Khabarovsk. At the same time, in cities with a high shopping centre penetration rate (for example Yekaterinburg, Samara, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Tyumen and Yaroslavl), many shopping malls need renovation. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In general, negotiations on commercial terms have become more individual and depend on the type of tenant. , owners of new shopping malls are having to reduce rental rates in USD equivalent by: the use of an exchange rate corridor, the permanent or temporary fixing of exchange rates pegged to the exact date, a switch to percent of turnover, the reduction of rental rates, the lengthening of rent holidays, compensation for fit-out.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
Michael Rogozhin, Managing director of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cbre.rentnow.ru/en/services/retail_agency/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; &amp;gt;Retail Department&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, CORE.XP in Russia comments:
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;ldquo;Main threat for retail property market in 2015 will come from weakening purchasing power. Sharp Rouble depreciation in 2014-beginning of 2015 and ongoing price increase will adjust consumer demand toward the day-to-day consumption. Therefore import-oriented retailers of nonfood segment will be under the risk. For tenants it means that they have to become more active in terms of cost-management and pricing. For landlords decline in consumer activity can result in decrease of footfall and loss of tenants. There is a high probability that landlords in 2015 will become more flexible in negotiating commercial terms, besides not only in newly constructing projects, but also in established shopping malls. This scenario still might be cancelled if government is able to ensure “soft landing&amp;rdquo; economy.”

For the first time in the Moscow office market, new supply of Class A exceeded Class B (713,000 sq m and 693,000 respectively).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Important events for the city’s office market in 2014 included:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1.4 mln. sq m is the highest amount of new office buildings commissioned since 2009&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More than half of the buildings are Class A: President Plaza, OKO, Stalnaya Vershina, Arcus 3, Mebe One Khimki Plaza, Krasnaya Roza Morozov Phase II and Demidov, Vodny, Lotos, Comcity Phase Alfa, Romanov Dvor III, Dominion Tower, and K2 building A &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The area outside the TTR has traditionally seen the largest amounts of new office delivery (69% of the total)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up totalled 736,700 sq m, a sharp decrease of 31% compared to 2013&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;73% of total take-up was Class B space, and 27% Class A&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;39% of total take-up was in the area between the TTR and MKAD, versus 50% in 2013&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian companies remained the most active with 84% of the total take-up&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Office units up to 1,000 sq m were in high demand, representing 77% of the total number of transactions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Overall vacancy increased significantly from 12% in 2013 to 16.6% in 2014In Class B space, vacancy increased from 11% to 12.8%; the increase in Class A was more substantial, from 17% to 28%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Achievable rents decreased by 20-30% compared to the beginning of 2014. Asking rents fell by 15-20% in 2014 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tenants are asking for rents to be denominated in Roubles. If the rent is not requested in Roubles, the required rent is achieved by means of fixing the bottom level of the exchange rate. Owners try to meet the requirements if they want to keep tenants. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The exchange rate band is usually at the level of 45-55 Roubles for a term from 6 months up to 2 (even 3) years &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Total take-up for 2014 amounted to 736,700 sq m (including new leases and purchase of premises for owner-occupier use, excluding renewal of current lease and investment purchases). The volume of deals transacted in 2013 is 3% more than in 2012 (1.036 million sq m) that is 31% less than in 2013. This reduction is primarily due to the sharp fall in demand in Q2 when take-up was 60% less than the quarterly average. Transactions in the remaining quarters ranged from 200,000 to 230,000 sq m. Take-up for 2014 is comparable to 2003 (708,000 sq m). Transactions increased to 850,000 sq m in 2004 and had exceeded 1 million sq m every year since 2005. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Among large transactions in decentralised office buildings it is worth mentioning Systematica and Oracle leased office space in Comcity office park (17,300 sq m and 6,300 sq m respectively), as well as PepsiCo (13,000 sq m) in Alcon BC and Saint-Gobain (3,000 sq m) in Preo 8 BC. Large transactions in decentralised office buildings spotlight ongoing decentralisation trends and companies’ desire to reduce rental costs.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 sale transactions (for owner occupation) totalled 128,500 sq m (17% of total take-up). In 2013 this figure was 181,000 sq m (17% of total take-up).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 there were two large sale deals: Mosoblgaz purchased a building in the Pallau-RB complex (total area &amp;ndash; 9,150 sq m); Sogaz purchased an office building on Ulansky Lane (total area – 16,300 sq m). The remainder were small office units from 50 to 3,000 sq m. Most transactions were in complexes such as Vodny MFC, Lotos, Savelovsky City, G10 Business Park, and AERO City. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Transneft could have purchased Evolution Tower in Moscow-City in 2014 and could have become the most significant deal of 2014, which would have increased take-up by 80,000 sq m (an additional 10%). However, the transaction was not completely closed in 2014 and may increase take-up in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP’s forecast, in 2015 about 1.4 mln. sq m is expected to be commissioned, which is comparable to 2014. Class A will continue to represent a high percentage of the total new delivery – 57%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This market situation is comparable to 2009, when, despite the crisis in the real estate market, a large amount of space was introduced (1.8 mln. sq m in 2008, 1.6 mln. sq m in 2009). Following the trend of the previous crisis, the volume of new construction may reduce significantly in 2016-2018 (950,000 sq m was commissioned in 2010, 603,800 sq m in 2011, 556,000 sq m in 2012).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
It is estimated that the volume of transactions will remain at the level of 2014, 750,000 - 850,000 sq m. However, these transactions will consist mainly of companies moving from one building to another in order to obtain the best commercial terms, while net absorption may become negative. The current willingness of landlords to provide more favourable commercial terms to keep tenants will play a major role in the level of transactions. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Against the background of a large amount of new office construction and low demand, vacancy will increase. According to our estimates, the Class A vacancy rate will reach 29-30%, and Class B 14-15%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The number of Class B projects, that offer office space in Rouble rent will increase.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to our forecast, asking rental rates will continue to decline, at least in H1 2015. According to CORE.XP’s estimations the rental rates could fall by 10-30% from their current level for the following reasons: either the Rouble strengthens and as a consequence there is a reduction in the Rouble rent equivalent; or there is a reduction in rents denominated in Dollars, which seems more likely in the current environment.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to our forecast, the highest change in asking rents will occur in H1 2015, after which the market is expected to experience a relatively stable period.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Research, CORE.XP in Russia commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;2014 became the year of records for the office market. New delivery indicated the highest volumes from 2009 – 1,4 mln. sq m, take up was as low as in 2003, while rental rate decreased by more than 20% after 2 years of flat dynamics. In H1 2015 we expect to see rental rates, continuing downward trend. Depending on the macroeconomic scenario, the size of decline might reach 10 to 30%. This will occur on the background of vacancy, reaching peak levels of 2008-2009 crisis – 19-20%. However, after tough H1 2015 we expect to see some stabilization on the market with more or less stable rental rates and stopped increase in vacancy.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

 Natalya Nikitina, Director, Global Corporate Services Department, CORE.XP said : &amp;ldquo;Our client was in negotiations with their current landlord themselves since November 2013. In September 2014 CORE.XP was chosen to exclusively represent Rusfinance Bank in their lease renegotiations project. It is always quite challenging to negotiate the new terms when the client has already received some discounts directly from the landlord. We managed to achieve the commercial terms that satisfied both parties. I am very much pleased with the results.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 developers delivered to the market the same amount of I&amp;amp;amp;L space as in 2012 and 2013 altogether. Newly came 1.6 mln. sq m is the record high new delivery in the history of Moscow and regional I&amp;amp;amp;L market. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest chunk of supply was speculative by nature, i.e. did not have contracted tenant pool by the moment of project development. It was as large as 71% of the new delivery, or 1.1 mln. sq m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Around 498,000 sq m were announced for delivery in Q1 2015. 40% of them are the projects which were initially planned to see the market at the end of 2014. By now, only 19% of all announced delivery has contracted tenant or buyer. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
North, South-East and South were the key destinations of new construction activity in 2014. Altogether they account for 76% of new supply. For example around 495,000 sq m, or 30% of yearly supply, were constructed on the land plots nearby &amp;ldquo;Small Betonka&amp;rdquo; (A107), limited by Leningradskoye and Dmitrovskoye highways. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Take up in 2014 amounted to 0.94 mln. sq m, which is 23% less compared to 2013 (1.23 mln. sq m). Demand structure evolved, as well. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retail remained active in 2014. Food and FMCG, and online players increased their activity by 22% and 24%, respectively. Non-food retail leased and acquired 6% less space than in 2013. However, its activity still was 30% above average in 2011-2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Logistics companies kept the same level of activity as in 2013. It still was 30% above year average, achieved in 2011-2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand from distributors shrank significantly, i.e. by 80% compared to 2013 and by 68% compared to the year average in 2011-2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Share of forward and BTS transactions decreased. Large amount of vacant premises, offered at relatively low rental rates, incentivizes potential tenants to make choice from the already constructed space rather than thinking about forward deals. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vacancy rate tripled since the beginning of 2014, having reached 8,8% at its end.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Downward pressure on the rental rates continued in Q4 2014, as a result of combined aggressive development and sharp Rouble depreciation. 85% of marketed offers (both operating and under construction properties) are now nominated in Roubles. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabiev, Head of I&amp;amp;amp;L department of CORE.XP Russia, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;laquo;Current situation with large amount of available space is expected to continue in the mid-term period. We already see formation of prerequisites for new market balance: amount of space under construction started shrinking. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental rates at $80-90 might be sustainable for some period, if construction costs are able to stabilize around $500 / sq m which became possible as a result of sharp Rouble depreciation. However, the most probable mid-term scenario assumes that in 1-1,5 years inflation will increase construction costs back to $700+. In this case sustainable rental rates will return to at least $110/sq m, or will be higher&amp;raquo;.&#13;

Strong Signs of Growth in UK Market &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 10 February 2015 &amp;ndash; European commercial real estate markets saw further yield improvements in Q4 2014 across all property sectors reflecting growing investor demand and very low bond yields, according to the EMEA Prime Rents and Yields survey from global property advisor CORE.XP. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime yields fell across all main sectors, to stand at least 30 basis points lower than they were at the end of the previous year. Within this general picture, office yields saw the most substantial change in the quarter, with yields down by 11 basis points compared with Q3. This was driven by yields moving lower in 24 of the 58 office locations surveyed, including the major markets of Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid and the City of London. The only markets that saw yields moving higher in Q4 were Moscow and St Petersburg where investor sentiment has been dented by geopolitical challenges and falling oil prices.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Yields also moved lower in the retail and industrial sectors. Notable changes in the quarter included high street retail yields moving lower in Paris, Prague and Milan, while industrial yields fell in London, Dublin, Amsterdam and Barcelona.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The incidence of rental increase remains uneven, with lingering concerns over the strength of economic recovery in some countries still affecting corporate appetite for expansion. The CORE.XP All-Property EMEA Rent Index rose by 1.3% in the quarter and only 23 of the 163 locations surveyed saw any improvement. The office sector accounted for fifteen of these, including the major London markets of the City and West End, as well as Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan. This pushed the office rent index up by 1.6% in the quarter (2.7% YonY). Fewer retail locations saw upward rental movement, but significant increases in Dublin, Munich and Dubai were sufficient to push the EMEA prime retail rent index up by over 1% in the quarter. Industrial rents were flat over the quarter in aggregate terms although London rents did see a 2% increase.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A notable feature of this quarter&amp;rsquo;s data was the contribution of UK markets to many of the main EMEA-level changes. In the office sector, rents rose in seven of the eight locations surveyed while yields fell in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast as well as the City of London. In the industrial market, London was one of only three locations to see any rental uplift and also recorded further decline in yields, as did Manchester.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Commenting, Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research at CORE.XP, added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Strong investor appetite for real estate pushed total European turnover well over &amp;euro;200bn in 2014, and, with bond yields in the major markets continuing to trend downwards, we have seen prime property yields move lower again. Leasing markets are not yet showing the same degree of momentum but with economic growth expected to accelerate from this year, we anticipate leasing activity and rental growth rising more widely.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
YIELDS&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Office yields across EMEA decreased in Q4 2014. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index fell by five bps in the quarter, and is now 30 bps lower than a year ago. Twenty four of the 58 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter, 32 remained unchanged and two rose. Oslo and Lisbon saw yields move 50bps lower. A number of markets saw yields drop by 25 bps including the City of London, Madrid and Edinburgh. The two increases occurred in Moscow (112bps) and St Petersburg (113bps).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retail yields also moved lower in Q4 2014, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail Yield Index down by eight bps, and the corresponding Prime Shopping Centre Yield Index down by two bps, leaving them respectively 34 bps and 36 bps lower than a year ago. Yields fell in 20 locations, rose in two and remained static in the remaining 32. The largest downward shifts (50bps) were observed in a number of markets, including Prague and Oslo. Moscow and St Petersburg recorded the only upward shifts of 87bps and 88bps respectively.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Industrial yields fell in Q4 2014, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Yield Index down by five bps in the quarter, and 32 bps over the year. Yields fell in 15 locations, rose in two and remained static in the other 34. The largest downward movement occurred in Lisbon (75bps) while Dublin and Bucharest were 50bps lower and London 30 bps. Helsinki, Budapest, Barcelona and Manchester all saw yields drop by 25bps. Again the largest increase was recorded in Moscow, up 150 bps to a prime yield of 12.75%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
RENTS&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime office rents across Europe rose in Q4 2014, up by 1.6% in the quarter and 2.7% year-on-year. Among the 15 markets where rents moved higher, the largest increases were recorded in Marseille and Belfast where rents grew by 11% and 7% respectively. A number of larger markets including London, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan saw increases of 2-4%. St Petersburg saw the largest fall (-34%), with Moscow office rents declining by 25%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime retail rents rose in Q4 2014, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail index up 1.1% and the Shopping Centre Rent index only up by 0.1%. Five of the 54 markets surveyed registered an increase, 46 remained unchanged, and three fell. Rents in Dublin (11%) and Riga (7%) grew the most out the various retail markets. St Petersburg saw the largest drop in rents (-36%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime industrial rents were largely unchanged in Q4 2014, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up by just 0.1% in the quarter, and 0.8%% in year-on-year terms. Three of the 51 sample locations rose, four fell and the remaining 44 stayed unchanged. The largest increases were seen in Dubai (6%) and Dusseldorf (4%). In comparison to this, the largest drop in rentals were in St Petersburg (-14%) and Kyiv (-12%).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Head of Research in CORE.XP Russia, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Perspectives of economic growth in Europe remain pretty weak. In addition, they worsened compared to the situation just a few quarters back. As a result, rental rates in the majority of European markets stopped their growth and now follow flat dynamics. However, investors continue increasing their activity: in 2014 investment operations with European commercial real estate jumped by 32%. This process is driven by minimal yields, offered by other fixed income investments.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Russia situation remain quite complicated under the pressure of threat of noticeable decline in economic activity and sharp Rouble depreciation. However, there is still a probability that market will reach its bottom in 1H 2015, followed by more stable trends in key commercial indicators.”&#13;

CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s facilities management client base is comprised of over 110 corporations, healthcare providers and government institutions across 105 countries. During the year, CORE.XP took on management responsibilities of more than 140 million sq. ft. of facilities.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;CORE.XP is extremely pleased to see the continued momentum in our facilities management services worldwide,&amp;rdquo; said Alex Darragh, Global Director of CORE.XP’s Facilities Management service line. “We have realized strong growth across our Americas, APAC and EMEA regions, as an increasing number of multinational and regional companies are experiencing the benefits of facilities management outsourcing. Most notably, the acquisition of Norland Managed Services bolstered our service offering for our EMEA business, particularly with respect to critical environments services for specialty assets like data centers and trading floors.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Americas region accounted for 105 million sq. ft. of the increase as CORE.XP added new clients or expanded business with large-portfolio clients such as CHRISTUS in 2014. The amount of facilities space managed in the Asia Pacific region grew by 20 million sq. ft. with the addition of regional clients such as Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, which is headquartered in Auckland. Our EMEA region had a strong year, increasing the amount of managed facilities by 17 million sq. ft., and attracting clients like Zoetis, a global animal health company.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Ian Entwisle, CEO of EMEA Global Corporate Services for CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Facilities Management remains a very popular real estate function to outsource in EMEA. Innovation and risk management have become core parts of the attraction of the service. This means companies realize they can create competitive advantages through leveraging scale and utilizing advances in technology to create better work environments.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition to the growth in new and expanded portfolios within each world region, CORE.XP also renewed multi-year facilities management contracts with 19 existing clients in 2014. These renewed client contracts total an additional 155 million sq. ft. of facilities that CORE.XP will manage over the next three to five years. CORE.XP’s growth in the facilities management space in 2014 brings the size of the firm’s total managed facilities portfolio to 3.5 billion sq. ft.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 CORE.XP expanded portfolio in the Russian regions, taking on management responsibilities of more than 603,000 sq. ft. in Ufa and Nizhnevartovsk. Additionally, CORE.XP signed contracts for managing offices of some leading international companies. Currently CORE.XP has over 4.8 million sq. ft. property and corporate facilities under management.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Dmitriy Sveshnikov, Managing Director, Head of Asset Services in CORE.XP Russia, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Despite the strengthening competition between major international FM-companies in 2014 and practice of the new Russian players, ambitiously entering the market, to dump facilities management services cost, CORE.XP has not lost any of its projects. Moreover, CORE.XP renewed 4 contracts, which were subject to an open bid for FM services in 2014, totaling 516,668 sq. ft. Thereby CORE.XP has proved the quality of rendered services and partnership reliability with existing clients.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
For the whole year, total new delivery of I&amp;amp;amp;L space in the Russian regions amounted to 700,000 sq m, 70% of which were BTS-projects or space constructed after the agreement of a contract with a tenant/purchaser.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Significant trends for I&amp;amp;amp;L market in the Russian regions in H2 2014 include: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In the second half of 2014, total new delivery in regional centres (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg) amounted to 450,000 sq m, making 700,000 sq m for the whole year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Only 30% of the new delivery was speculative. 70% of the new I&amp;amp;amp;L space consisted of BTS-projects or space constructed after the agreement of a contract with a tenant/purchaser. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Total take-up in the regions rose 30% compared with 2013 and reached 368,000 sq m, which was in line with business activity in the FMCG retail sector.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Overall, 2014 in the regional centres was characterised by a continuation of the trend seen in 2012-2013: development of new projects following BTS or pre-let/pre-sale agreements with tenants/ purchasers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
By the end of the second half of 2014, the structure of the local regional markets in Russia was as follows:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Moscow and St. Petersburg markets represented 74% of the Russian market (60% and 14% respectively).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The actively growing markets are Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Samara, each of which represents 3-5% of the total market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The remaining regional centres represented 16% of the market; in these centres, low demand is determining the level of development.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Demand&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
Total take-up in the regions in the second half of 2014 stood at 172,000 sq m. Transactions in the whole year therefore totalled 368,000 sq m, which represents an increase of 30% on 2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Compared with the Moscow Region and St. Petersburg, regional markets are still characterized by a higher share of direct deals in total leasing activity that can reach 80% of local take-up.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest deals of 2014 were completed in PNK-Tolmachovo in Novosibirsk: Holiday Classic leased 50,000 sq m, Fix Price purchased 23,000 sq m, and Okey leased 13,000 sq m. In 2014 these companies absorbed 53% of total take-up, which is usual for the local markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;New delivery&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
In the second half of 2014, total new supply in the regions (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg) stood at 450,000 sq m. For the whole year, total new delivery amounted to 700,000 sq m, which represents a record for the Russian regional warehouse market since 2009.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 the highest amount of new space was delivered in Novosibirsk, where, along with smaller projects, a new building in the PNK-Tolmachevo warehouse complex project was completed (50,000 sq m). This was built for the FMCG retail chain Holiday Classic. Another notable completion in Novosibirsk was the multi-temperature Logopark Sever warehouse, totalling 25,000 sq m. Voronezh, where completions included the Magnit and X5 distribution centres, was second in terms of new delivery. Chita saw the third highest amount of new space, with the completion of the first building in the Kenon freight terminal, aimed for the Manzhouli-Zabaikalsk multi-modal transport hub.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The most developed regions (in terms of total size of stock) are Novosibirsk (701,000 sq m), Yekaterinburg (610,000 sq m), Samara (386,000 sq m). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
1.2 mln. sq m has been announced for delivery in regional centres in 2015, 498,000 sq m of which is under construction. It is difficult to estimate how much of the remaining 700,000 sq m that has been announced will actually be completed during the year. Developers are already exercising due caution in the regions and holding back new projects that do not have a real tenant/purchaser. This trend will continue in 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest delivery pipeline is planned in Novosibirsk: new buildings for several retail chains (Magnit, Gloria Jeans and FixPrice) are already under construction in the IP Novosibirsk Region Industrial and logistics park.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vacancy rates in the most developed markets amounted to 4-8% of the total stock. The lowest and highest vacancy figures are in the cities which have an under-developed market. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
By the end of 2014, average asking rents for class A and B property were close to RUR 4,000/sq m/year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental rates in Roubles including operating expenses (gross rent) have been quite typical for the regions in the past, but, since the second half of 2014, this practice has become widespread (excluding current lease agreements in certain complexes, in which the practice of rents in Dollars or/and triple net rent is continuing).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The average differential in rents between projects in the regions depends more on the quality of the project than on the city where the project is located.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Notably, some class A projects are offered at rental rates ranging from RUR 4,500 to RUR 5,600 per sq m per year (excl. VAT).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Oxana Fedulova, Associate Director, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The total new supply in the regions in 2014 became the record since 2009. However the regional markets are going on characterized by a shortage of quality warehouse space. The average penetration rate in large cities (with a population of more than 1 mln.) has not changed since the beginning of the year: there is 0.47 sq m of warehouse space per 1 sq m of retail space. In addition in a number of the cites the penetration rate fall as a result of the time-lag between the development of the retail stock and the warehouse stock.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabiev, Head of I&amp;amp;amp;L department of CORE.XP Russia, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The main occupiers of the warehouse spaces on the regional markets are the major food retailers (X5, Magnit, Lenta, Holiday Classic, etc.), which develop the local markets actively absorbing the warehouse spaces due to the retail expansion.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This trend is the usual for the local markets and it will be continue in 2015. Almost half-million sq m has already constructed in regions for national chain needs.”&#13;

These new tenants opened their store and a restaurant in Sibirskiy Mall which was put into operation in 2008. The anchor tenants there for many years are Auchan City, M.Video, MODIS, Snezhnaya Koroleva and Champion.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of Sibirskiy Mall is 67,000 sq m, of which 40,000 sq m is GLA. The shopping mall is very well located in the centre of Novosibirsk. Although it is not new (it was put into operation in 2008) it is still very popular among citizen of Novosibirsk. Over 400,000 people live near the shopping mall.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mikhail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Even though Sibiskiy Mall was opened in 2008 it continues to grow its list of tenants and attracts new stong brands. The fact that such brands as FunDay and McDonald’s opened in this location proves the interest to the project ferom both international and well-known Russian retailors. FunDay is very representative as another store of the same retail chain O’STIN has been successfully working in Sibirian Mall for a long time.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investment activity in nearly all European countries was significantly higher in 2014 than in 2013. Scandinavia, Germany and Southern Europe presented the region&amp;rsquo;s strongest growth with volumes increasing by 89%, 74% and 50% respectively year-on-year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In line with tradition the three major markets in Europe, the UK, Germany and France, accounted for the majority (62%) of reported volumes. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014 the UK continued to attract the highest levels of hotel investment activity taking 36% share of investment volumes. This was supported by large portfolio deals including the QMH portfolio bought by Marathon in August and the LRG portfolio purchased by Kew Green; a trend that is likely to continue in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Germany secured the second highest share of European investment activity in 2014, changing position with France. Investment levels surged throughout 2014, reaching €3 billion of transactions despite a slight slowdown in trading growth across some gateway cities. International buyers were the most active and despite a quiet first half of the year, investment activity heightened significantly in the closing two quarters initiated by the sale of the 342 Hilton Frankfurt.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investment volumes in France declined in 2014 compared to the previous year, largely due to a notably strong 2013 where a number of high price tag assets were acquired. 2014 also raised some concerns over declining revenue per available room (RevPAR) particularly in the capital, Paris, largely due to austerity measures implemented in France and the related impact on corporate and consumer demand, however, Paris does remain the highest RevPAR performing market in Europe.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Joe Stather, Information and Intelligence Manager EMEA, CORE.XP Hotels, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The European hotel market has reflected a trend visible in the wider commercial real estate landscape which is benefiting from low interest rates and cyclical upturns. More specifically, hotels as an asset class, are currently presenting yield premiums significantly above traditional real estate segments such as office and retail, even across prime locations. More investors are becoming aware of the opportunity for strong returns in the sector and increasing transparency is aiding confidence. As a result we are expecting to see heightened investor appetite to deploy capital into the hotel arena throughout 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Whilst demand will further intensify from typical sources of capital, we are also likely to see increased interest from Asian investors following a relaxation of cross-border investment restrictions and their preference for purchasing quality hotel stock in Europe.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrey Novikov, Managing Director, Head of Capital Markets in CORE.XP Russia, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In 2014 investments in Russian hotels amounted to $530 mln., or 15% of the total investment volumes. However, it is worth of mentioning that, unlike in European markets, hotel segment in Russia did not enjoy large transaction activity even during high investment activity of previous years. To large extent this is due to the deficit of quality investment products for sale and relatively big amount of trophy assets, which are exposed to the market in very rare cases. Rouble depreciation created very strong prerequisites for substantial increase in inflow of foreign tourists. The only obstacle for realization of this potential is geopolitical tensions. Nonetheless, this segment seems to be the most attractive in mid-term compared to all other sectors of Russian commercial real estate.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Lipsey, a training and professional development firm specializing in commercial real estate, has surveyed commercial real estate professionals on their perceptions of the industry&amp;rsquo;s leading brands since 2001.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK was the strongest performer in 2014 with values rising 12.9% on Q4 2013. Values in Southern Europe rebounded in the second half of the year to see a 3.6% rise year-on-year, and there were also positive levels of growth in France and Germany of 3.3% and 2.7% respectively. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The industrial sector was the best performing asset class with values rising 8.5% in 2014, with offices seeing 3.9% growth and retail 2.5%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets continued to see property values fall quarter on quarter (-0.4% in Q4) led by a decrease in the office and retail markets. This is largely down to older stock coming under pressure from new developments in the region. However, industrials in the region saw an increase in values of 3.8% in Q4 and were up by 9.1% year-on-year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Matthew Edmonds, Analyst, EMEA Valuation and Advisory, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Equivalent yields have compressed across the full spectrum of real estate quality for the first time since 2007, suggesting that investors are now looking at all sectors of the commercial real estate market and although their focus remains on prime they are increasingly considering assets further along the risk curve, moving into secondary and more peripheral markets.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Head of Research, CORE.XP, Russia, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In Russia capital values in 2014 decreased on average by 25-35% under influence of growing vacancy and high financial markets volatility. This decline remains heterogeneous, and properties with low vacancy indicate higher resilience against downward pressure on the asset prices. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2015 the latter will continue, driven by weakening economic activity and high new deliveries due to the completion of current projects in the advanced construction stages. The potential of additional decline in prices is estimated at around 10-20%. However, it is worth mentioning that increasing probability of economy “soft landing” scenario assumes that capital values might start recovering already in early 2016. In I&amp;amp;amp;L segment this trend might appear even in H2 2015”.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Russian market in long term remains very attractive for the international retailers&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 6 March 2015 &amp;ndash; The new research from global property advisor CORE.XP reveals that international expansion remains high on the agenda for retailers in 2015, in spite of uncertain economic prospects and cost escalation. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
47% of retailers surveyed in How Active are Retailers Globally indicated that unclear economic prospects and cost escalation, largely due to increases in rental costs and lack of quality retail space, are the biggest concerns for 2015. However, despite these challenges appetite for international expansion remains a strong focus as retailers continue to invest in their store network throughout 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP, Germany has retained its number one position for the second consecutive year as the most popular retail market in the world with 40% of retailers planning to open a store there in 2015. Germany is closely followed by the UK with 33% and France with 31% of retailers.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Global retailers continue to be attracted to Germany largely due to the opportunity to target more than 30 large cities with high purchasing power. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the huge interest in the German market retail rents in most of the markets have remained stable or have seen a slight increase. The UK also continues to be a popular target for overseas retailers as demand for store space remains resilient, especially in London. This is evident from the strong prevailing rental growth and high premiums. France follows closely behind the UK attracting retailers due to its mature market with several strong cities and a large number of very successful shopping centres across the country. Retailers are generally attracted to the ability to get critical mass quickly, and have focussed on Paris and the Paris region before expanding into other cities. Recent changes to Sunday trading days from five to 12 per year in some areas, and the creation of Zones Of International Tourism, which will allow Sunday opening all year round is further improving the attractiveness of France to retailers.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Peter Gold, Head of Cross-Border Retail, CORE.XP, commented: &amp;ldquo;Given the ongoing challenges retailers face from cost escalation, successful delivery of omni-channel, and changes in consumer behaviour, it is increasingly important for them to have a strong network of stores to effectively represent their brand. The cost to open a new store remains prohibitive and retailers now have to look beyond key areas to traditionally less premium sites. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The positive aspect of this is seen as the growth in the quality of the retailers giving a halo effect to a wider geographical spread of stores. There is still a slight hesitancy to expand in some markets linked to either remaining or developing economic uncertainty. Retailers have recognised the overwhelmingly positive attitude that shoppers have to engaging with the physical store environment and are committed to opening more stores. This gives further credence to the view that the retail experience remains absolutely fundamental to the shopper. &amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The physical store remains the destination of choice for consumers as retailers continue to open stores in diverse locations with 21% of retailers planning to open between one to five stores in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region by the end of the year. Large scale expansion plans with retailers looking to open more than 40 stores has scaled back to 9% in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Unlike European markets, Russia is not a priority target for the new international chain retailers due to the complicated geopolitical situation, Ruble depreciation, inflation and weakening customer demand. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2011 11 new international chains announced their plans to enter Russian market in 2015. In Q1 2015 2 additional players joined this pool. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
However, now both already working in Russian and potential entrants are trying to use momentum and to negotiate the best possible commercial terms. As a result, they do not hurry up with opening of new shops. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
For example, in Q1 2015 only 1 Italian perfume and cosmetics brand Santa Maria Novella opened its store in Moscow. In Q1 2014 there were 8 newly opened shops from different brands and 2 monobrands, who launched their shops in the additional destinations. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Since 2014 international retailers increased their activity in entering Russian market not via Moscow, but via regional cities. In early 2015 German street-food brand OLIVA opened its first stores in Saint-Petersburg. Greek caf&amp;eacute; chain La Croissanterie is close to completion of fit-out works in its first café in Barnaul. Spain brand of clothes and footwear Florentino is close to opening of its first store in shopping center Galereya Radischeva, Yekaterinburg. &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;laquo;All in all, despite quite complicated geopolitical and, hence, economic situation, Russian market in long term remains very attractive for the international retailers. With improvement of economic perspectives in 2015 Russia might witness 15-20 international newcomers&amp;raquo;.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As Asian investors increase their exposure to global real estate, they are diversifying their geographic and sector footprint. 2013 saw transactions centered on global gateway cities, predominantly in the office sector.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2014, while London remained the preferred destination and offices the asset class of choice, a greater range of asset types and cities were invested in. Throughout the year investors looked to the next tier of cities, including locations such as Paris, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. This is also demonstrated by the news that the first direct investment by an Asian institution in Dutch real estate has completed with Singaporean institution First Sponsor Group, acquiring Zuiderhof 1. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition, EMEA remains by some way the biggest centre for Asian outbound investment, attracting US$13.7 billion (34%) of capital from the region in 2014. Overall, EMEA accounted for 50% more Asian investment than the Americas (US$8.9 billion in 2014).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a country level, there were some notable trends in 2014, Asian investment in Germany increased markedly from US$984 million (&amp;euro;746 million) in 2013 to US$2.373 billion (€1.843 billion) in 2014. Spain and Italy also saw substantial investments from Asian buyers. In Spain US$522 million was spent versus nothing in 2013 and Italy saw US$451 million after just US$4 million in the prior year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a sector level globally, hotels were the biggest beneficiary of Asian investors looking beyond office markets, capturing 16% of total international spend vs 11% in 2013. In Europe, they invested ten times more capital year over year in the sector – US$1.370 billion (€1.04 billion) in 2014 versus US$137 million (€102 million) in 2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Across the board investor activity grew, with Singapore becoming the largest source of Asian capital, followed by China and Hong Kong. Taiwanese and Chinese insurers in particular grew their international real estate investment activities, by 770% and 310% respectively in the year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Head of EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Asian investors are hugely attracted to the European market and particularly its gateway cities. The trends we saw in 2014 represent an expected progression in their investment strategies – which has seen an expansion of their footprint into new cities and sectors as they become more confident in the market. We expect this trend to continue in Europe this year, as we have already seen in Holland with First Sponsor Group&amp;rsquo;s recent acquisition of the Zuiderhof 1 office building.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Marc Giuffrida, Executive Director, Global Capital Markets, Asia, CORE.XP, added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Last year was an important year for cross-border real estate investing&amp;mdash;we saw the deployment of capital accelerate as a convergence of structural and cyclical factors encouraged pockets of new capital to enter the market. This is a key trend we expect will continue into 2015. The second half of 2014 saw Chinese and Taiwanese insurers begin to feature prominently in global real estate markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Alongside the emergence of new capital, the early adopters of global investing are starting to evolve their strategies beyond the traditional gateway cities. While the acquisition of trophy assets continued to attract headlines, and New York and London remain the top destinations for investment, perhaps the biggest untold story for 2014 has been the movement into secondary gateway cities such as Paris and LA as well as regional centers of the UK. This trend can be best seen in the falling concentration of the top five global destinations among the total pool of Asian cross-border investment. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Likewise, there is a shift in the types of assets Asian investors are seeking. While office continues to be the preferred asset class, particularly for new investors, there was a significant uptick in activity in hotels and industrial assets. Investors feel that by looking to new markets and asset classes they will be able to secure better yields and face less competition from other investors.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Asian investors did not show noticeable systemic activity on the Russian commercial real estate market until 2014. Closure of Western capital markets for Russian companies forced government and corporates to strengthen Eastern direction of development. These efforts brought their results and led to increasing interest of Asian investors to the Russian market. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Acquisition by sovereign fund “Qatar Investment Authority” of Pokrovsky Hills Complex became the landmark transaction of 2014. The deal size could exceed USD 400 mln. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Chinese investors discussed their participation in such large scale projects as: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;bull;	Redevelopment of ZIL industrial zone &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	Development of subway and residential and commercial real estate in New Moscow area &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
•	Development of intermodal hubs in Vladivostok and Leningradsky region &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Multifunctional complex “Chinese business center Park Huamin with GBA around 100,000 sq m was started in February 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Korean investors also increase their activity. For example, Lotte Group acquired hotel project nearby Isakievskaya square in Saint Petersburg for around RUR 1.6 bn. Additional investments in the project might exceed RUR 1 bn. They also indicated the interest to one of the most popular Moscow shopping malls Atrium with GBA above 100,000 sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anna Melnik, Head of Capital Markets Research, CORE.XP, Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“All these facts confirm the hypothesis that Asian investors are ready to revise their attitude to Russian commercial real estate market and increase their presence there”. &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Italy and France See Biggest Movement in Investor Sentiment &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London Remains Investors&amp;rsquo; Preferred Destination&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Cannes &amp;ndash; Moscow, 12 March 2015 - The search for yield is having a significant impact on European commercial real estate (CRE) investment according to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s 2015 Investor Intention’s Survey. As prime yields continue to improve, CRE investors are diversifying their investment strategies and also moving up the risk curve.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This diversification has led to an increased interest in &amp;lsquo;alternative’ real estate. Real estate debt has seen the most dramatic increase in activity over the last two years, from under &amp;euro;10 billion in 2012 to €49 billion in 2014 and is set to remain the preferred alternative choice this year. 32% of respondents stated that they will actively be pursuing opportunities in real estate debt in 2015, closely followed by student accommodation (27%), leisure/entertainment and healthcare (both 17%) and retirement living (15%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Of the traditional sectors, offices remain the most popular asset class by some margin, accounting for nearly half of all expected investment activity in 2015. However, there was also a noted preference this year for industrial and logistics assets, which is well in excess of the overall amount of investable stock, suggesting that demand is much greater than supply for this asset class. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Unsurprisingly, given the level of interest in real estate and the capital value growth that has been seen in recent years, access to competitively priced stock is the biggest problem for investors today. Nearly all (91%) investors cited one of ‘availability of assets’, ‘asset pricing’ or ‘competition from other investors’ as the biggest obstacle to activity. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This has also led to a shift in the types of assets being pursued and a move up the risk curve. Investors’ preference for good secondary has now overtaken prime by a small margin. However, the most interesting change is the strong jump in the attractiveness of value-add and opportunistic assets, 10% higher than in 2014, and now top of investors’ wish lists. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a country level, the UK remains the most attractive market for real estate investment in Europe, selected by 31% of all respondents, with Germany and Spain sharing second place on 15%. Beyond these top three results, which closely mirror investors’ preferences in 2014, there have been some substantial shifts. The largest change this year was the 10% of investors who selected France as EMEA’s most attractive market, up from just 5% last year. Italy also saw an increase attracting 6% of responses up from 4% in 2014. Both countries experienced a significant jump in investment activity in the final quarter of 2014, and in the case of Italy very nearly half the year’s turnover was seen in the final quarter, suggesting further investment growth in France and Italy this year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Respondents’ selections for city preference closely followed country level preferences. London was the most frequently chosen option at 30%, with Madrid second at 14%. Paris also produced a strong result with 10% of investors rating it as their preferred market and another significant mover was Milan, which attracted 5% of preferences. The main German cities combined were considered the most attractive investment location by 14% of respondents. In keeping with the theme of greater diversity of investment, cities outside the top ten attracted a substantial share of investors’ preferences, 19% in 2015 versus just 9% in 2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of EMEA Capital Markets at CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Investors are constantly having to evolve their investment strategies, in their pursuit of yield and returns, as demand for European commercial real estate shows no sign of abating. This diversification is leading investors into new markets and sector. However, there is still significant demand for core locations and assets, particularly from the growing influx of capital from outside the region. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Interestingly, a large proportion of respondents stated their intention to increase their overall trading activity, across a broader spectrum of risk, this year. This movement up the risk curve should benefit a far wider range of markets and sectors across the region.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist at CORE.XP, added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Despite the fact that core real estate prices are now markedly higher across most of Europe than a few years ago, investors are still strongly attracted to the region. This is not surprising given the spread of property yields over government bond rates. When compared to other territories, Europe still appears to offer the best value.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Russian CRE market seems to be close to the bottom of the asset prices. Since the beginning of 2014 the fall in prices for some assets exceeded 40%. There is a potential for one more downward wave in prices, which might decrease from the current levels by additional 15-25%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The high volatility of financial markets makes investment in CRE assets rather risky.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This is why it’s not accidentally that during the past 6 months (September, 2014 – February, 2015) total investment volume in the Russian commercial real estate amounted to just 790 mln. US dollars or less than 1,5 bn. US dollars annualized.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
For the last 6 months the investments of foreign companies amounted to 373 mln. US dollars or 47% of total investments, including 348 mln. US dollars or 44% - the share of Eastern Property Holdings.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the fact that Moscow has historically ranked in the top 5-7 of the most interesting European cities for investors in commercial real estate, the current risks have significantly reduced their interest. Mentions of Moscow or Russia as a region, which seriously interests the European investors, are still rare.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
However, the recovery of interest in the Russian commercial real estate might occur in the perspective of 2-3 years with volume of investment transactions returning to the level of 7 -9 bn. US dollars per year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The first signs of stabilization are appearing in I&amp;amp;amp;L segment, which reacts on the economic situation faster than any other sector. Nevertheless, the market remains under pressure of threats of another wave of decline in oil prices and GDP fall by more than 5% in 2015.”&#13;

The first stage of K2 consists of a seven-story office building with a leasable area of approximately 18,500 sq m. A premium supermarket will open on the ground floor and mezzanine of Building A. Total leasable area of the project is approximately 74,000 sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elena Denisova, Director of Office Agency department, CORE.XP: &amp;ldquo;Commissioning is a key stage of the project lifespan for the developer and equally for existing and potential tenants. The developer fulfilled its obligations to deliver on time which is at all times a highly valuable factor specifically in the current market conditions “.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The K2 Business Park has earned the title of the most sustainable office project in Russia by receiving the Excellent rating in accordance with the international assessment methodology BREEAM, as well as the prestigious title at Green Awards 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
An international design team has ensured that the K2 Business Park maximizes natural lighting, provides its tenants with highly efficient leasable space and an exceptional car-parking ratio (1:28). It will allow to experience the spaciousness of the building, as well as to organize the workspace according to company&amp;rsquo;s needs.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A low-density office development with a full-scale tenant amenities, located on a spacious landscaped territory, will create a unique atmosphere for business. The suburban location is benefited by a reverse commute that results in less traffic congestion along the way to and from K2 Business Park. In addition, corporate shuttle bus from the Teply Stan metro station will bring employees to the office in 5 minutes. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olga Korobeinikova, Project Manager of K2, noted: “A competitive advantage of the project is a unique combination of high quality of construction and attractive rental rates, which meets great demand among tenants. In the current economic conditions, leading Russian and foreign companies have a pragmatic approach to the selection of office space, trying to optimize costs. Currently we are negotiating with a number of companies who are interested in leasing the entire building or its part.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mike Strong, has spent more than 40 years at CORE.XP and its predecessor companies, and has served as Executive Chairman since 2001 and as Chief Executive Officer from 2005 to 2012. Mike Strong and Martin Samworth, Chief Executive Officer, EMEA, have together led the region for CORE.XP for the past two years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;This has been one of the most difficult decisions of my career,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Strong said. “CORE.XP has been a central part of my life for decades, and leaving behind my colleagues and valued clients will not be easy. But the timing is right. Our business in EMEA is in great shape. We just completed one of our best years ever in 2014. The Norland integration has exceeded expectations, and the EMEA region has a strong management team in place under Martin to lead us into the future. Now&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time for me to hand over the leadership reins and move on to the next phase of my life.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Mike Strong has had a brilliant career at CORE.XP,” said Bob Sulentic, Chief Executive Officer of CORE.XP. “His tenure as Executive Chairman has been a period of dramatic growth for CORE.XP across EMEA and as important, continuous improvement in the quality and scope of service we provide our clients. Mike also built a highly capable leadership team and in partnership with Martin Samworth, planned and executed a strategy in EMEA that leaves us well positioned for the future. On a personal level, I have benefited significantly from his experience, insight and counsel. We thank him for his exceptional service to CORE.XP -- our clients, employees and shareholders.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Under Mr. Strong’s leadership, CORE.XP’s total revenue in EMEA has grown from $450 million to $2.3 billion over the past 10 years. In this time, its EMEA employee base has increased from 3,600 to nearly 12,000 and its client base has expanded by more than 50%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Mike has been a terrific mentor to me and scores of other people at CORE.XP,” Mr. Samworth said. “I thank him for his support and counsel over the years and, on behalf of all our people across EMEA, wish him and his wife, Anne, all the very best for the future.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mr. Strong joined Richard Ellis (which was subsequently acquired by CORE.XP Group) in 1972.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vladimir Pinaev, CEO of CORE.XP in Russia: &amp;ldquo;We are happy to become a Capital Group's tenant in OKO high-rise. This deal is a perfect solution to place our headquarters in a premium class A building in the business heart of Moscow as well as to get mutually beneficial commercial terms that will add on to a long-term competitive advantages for our business.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentina Stanovova, first Vice President of Capital Group: “We have always been careful in choosing tenants, giving the preference to major Russian and Western corporations. We very much appreciate the fact that CORE.XP has become the first tenant of the OKO. It is obvious that before making the choice the company has made a thorough Moscow real estate market research using its best global expertise to find the best option. For us this agreement is the best proof that our new business centre meets the high standards imposed on class A+ office properties worldwide.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
OKO mixed-use complex is Capital Group's second high-rise development in Moscow-City business district. It has been created by an international team of leading design and construction firms. The design was developed by the US-based architect firm of SOM (Skidmore, Owings and Merrill). The general contractor is Turkey's company AntYapi. The office tower was put into operation in the end of 2014. The complex will be run by Capex Facility Management Company (owned by Capital Group).&#13;

Enters into Definitive Agreement to Acquire the Global Workplace Solutions Business of Johnson Controls, Inc. </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_PICTURE"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>text</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow, March 31, 2015 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Global WorkPlace Solutions (GWS) business of Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI). GWS is a market-leading provider of Integrated Facilities Management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world. The purchase price is $1.475 billion, payable in cash, or $1.3 billion net of the present value of estimated tax benefits, and with customary post-closing adjustments for working capital and other items. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
GWS will operate as part of CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s Global Corporate Services (GCS) business, which has increased revenue at a double-digit compound annual growth rate over the last decade, as more major corporations and other institutions outsource their real estate services. When the transaction is completed, the full range of combined occupier services – notably including CORE.XP’s leasing expertise and GWS’s engineering expertise – will be available to the clients of both companies.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The exceptionally talented GWS team will greatly enhance our service offering for occupiers around the world,&amp;rdquo; said Bob Sulentic, president and chief executive officer of CORE.XP. “With GWS, we further our ability to create advantages for occupier clients by aligning every aspect of how they lease, own, use and operate real estate to enhance their competitive position.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP and Johnson Controls also announced a 10-year strategic relationship. CORE.XP will provide Johnson Controls with a full suite of integrated corporate real estate services (including facilities management, project management and transaction services) on more than 50 million sq. ft. and Johnson Controls will offer a factory-direct relationship on HVAC equipment, building automation systems and related services to CORE.XP for its managed properties. In addition, the companies will jointly fund an innovation lab that will develop leading-edge energy management solutions to lower costs and enhance their clients’ work environments. The joint innovation lab will evaluate, connect and leverage products, services and energy data to create value for occupiers and investors of real estate.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Clients are increasingly asking us for fully integrated real estate and facilities solutions, which includes self-performing building technical services across their global portfolios,” said Bill Concannon, chief executive officer, GCS for CORE.XP. “GWS will further improve our ability to serve clients in more than 50 countries with a market-leading capability in all services, industry sectors and property types. The GWS team is a great fit for our business. They bring leadership and expertise in many areas that are vital to our clients, including engineering excellence, global supply chain management, mission-critical facilities and energy management.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
GWS serves a blue-chip roster of global corporations, particularly in the industrial/manufacturing, life-sciences, and technology sectors. Clients typically purchase these services under five-year contracts, and the average tenure for GWS’s 50 largest clients is 12 years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Upon closing, John Murphy, GWS’s president, will join CORE.XP as global chief operating officer, GCS. “This combination will create a global market leader in the provision of value-added occupier services that enable clients to derive maximum value from their workplaces. Together, we will assure clients of high-quality, reliable, cost-efficient, comfortable and safe working environments no matter their core business mission,” said Mr. Murphy. “The fit between our two organizations – be it culture, values, a client-centered ethos, or our commitment to engaged and empowered employees – is outstanding. This fit will help accelerate our coming together to create new value for our clients and shareholders. I am extremely excited about our future as part of the first-class team at CORE.XP. ”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Together, CORE.XP and GWS will manage nearly 5 billion sq. ft. of real estate and corporate facilities globally, including 2.3 billion sq. ft. in the Americas, 1.2 billion sq. ft. in Europe, the Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa and 1.4 billion sq. ft. in Asia Pacific. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
GWS, which has approximately 16,000 employees worldwide, generated approximately $3.4 billion of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP anticipates that GWS will be materially accretive to its adjusted earnings per share in 2016. It expects to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the incurrence of debt. The transaction is expected to close in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2015 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Simpson Thacher &amp;amp;amp; Bartlett LLP acted as CORE.XP’s legal advisor. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;In current economy there are two trends: companies either prefer to rise the class of their office building or renegotiate current lease terms. Our clients more often prefer to optimize office space that they occupy and to renegotiate commercial terms. &amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The total area of the first lease on Simferopolskoye highway is 15,823 sq. m. This warehouse is located in a separate building, with its own infrastructure and entrance. The second lease in the North of Moscow Region is 3,905 sq. m. The lease is signed for 6 years. The warehouse is located in MLP Leningradsky Terminal on Leningradsky Highway (M10), 13 km north-west of the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD). The M10 is a major goods transportation corridor, connecting Moscow to St. Petersburg and further to Finland and Western Europe. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 VELES Group has an extended distribution chain on the territory of Moscow and Moscow Region. The company provides professional distribution and logistics services. The newly leased warehouses in Chekhov Region and in MLP Leningradskiy terminal is the best solution for Veles group and their requirements for alcoholic products storage. The location of the warehouses is also ideal from geographic point of view that provides easy access to VELES group’s clients. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Anton Alyabyev, Director, Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Agency Services, CORE.XP said: &amp;ldquo;The rental rates for warehouse premises went down dramatically, that is why it is the best time for tenants to sign new lease agreements on optimal commercial terms. It is very much valuable for us that after the first lease agreement in the South of Moscow Region was signed VELES group came back to us to find another warehouse in the northern direction. We were able to sign an agreement in MLP Leningradskiy Terminal in a very short time on the commercial terms that satisfied all the parties of the deal. It is very important for CORE.XP when cooperation is not limited to just one deal and it becomes the beginning of a long-term relationship.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Middle Eastern buyers invested a total of $14.1 billion outside their home region in 2014, making the Middle East the third largest source of cross-regional capital globally,  despite a fall in total spend, according to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Middle East In and Out 2015&amp;rdquo; report. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Europe remains the preferred market for Middle Eastern investors, receiving $10.2 billion in 2014. In line with other investor groups, the year saw a major shift in investment strategies, with activity growing across second-tier European locations, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Budapest and Madrid. While still the most popular market, London received 32% of spend in 2014 compared to 45% in 2013, with Paris and New York growing their shares in 2014 to 16% and 10% respectively. London and Paris were the only two markets to retain a top five ranking in 2014.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Iryna Pylypchuk, Director, Global Capital Markets Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“There was a fall in outbound capital from the region from $16.1 billion invested globally in 2013 to $14.1 billion last year. In part, this is a function of difficulty in accessing product, and the large lot sizes these buyers tend to invest in. However, looking ahead and in light of weaker oil pricing, real estate acquisitions by sovereign wealth funds are expected to slow further in 2015 and beyond.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Historically, sovereign wealth funds have dominated Middle Eastern investor league tables &amp;ndash; accounting for around 50% of international commercial real estate acquisitions in 2013. While still the largest single investor group, Middle Eastern high net worth individuals, the private sector and other collective vehicles played a more significant role in role in global real estate markets in 2014.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pylypchuk added, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“In contrast to SWFs, lower oil prices may have triggered private capital to increase international allocations and speed up deployment faster than would have been the case otherwise. Our research clearly shows a greater allocation of investment to real estate and desire to diversify away from the home region. This has had a significant impact on Europe, where the combined investments of private wealth and equity funds from the Middle East grew by 49% year-on-year to $5.5 billion.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Saudi Arabia is the fastest growing source of outbound Middle Eastern investment. Capital outflows from the Kingdom grew rapidly in 2014, with $2.3 billion invested vs. nothing in 2013. Qatar was the largest source of Middle Eastern capital in 2014, with $4.9 billion invested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While an overall drop in spend was recorded, Nick Maclean, Managing Director, CORE.XP Middle East, added: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Middle East investors’ overseas real estate spend has grown amongst private and family offices and Saudi investors, as geographical diversification has become more important. We feel that this trend will accelerate over the next few years.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Middle Eastern investors’ interest to Russia is quite limited. There was only one investment transaction, which occurred in 2014. In this deal Qatar investment authority acquired residential complex “Pokrovsky Hills”, which is leased mainly to expats. One of American Goldman Sachs investment funds was the seller in that transaction. There has been no investment activity of Middle Eastern investors in Russia in 2015 so far. Key reasons for this situation include geopolitical problems and relatively high current investment risks. As a result, in 2015 we do not expect to see a noticeable activity of investors from this region on the Russian commercial real estate market.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 the vacancy rate in Moscow warehouse market exceeded 10% for the first time in the modern market history, and amounted to 10.9%, according to the latest research from CORE.XP. Record figure of 1 million sq m of vacant spaces generally was formed by active delivery of new properties. However, further increase in vacancy is unlikely. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow warehouse market is characterised by the following trends: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A large number of projects launched in 2014 are still coming to the market. As a result, supply in H1 2015 remains high: 363,000 sq m was commissioned in Q1 and 359,000 sq m is expected for delivery in Q2. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The development may almost come to halt in H2 2015 compensating a surplus of unoccupied space on the market. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The lack of new projects should result in the decrease of options for major tenants.  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Despite weak demand, quarterly take-up amounted to 255,000 sq m and 40% of it was produced by just one just one XXL-Warehouse transaction (100,000 sq m). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;90% of current market offerings, including both delivered projects and those under construction, are denominated in RUR. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average weighted rents have not changed since the beginning of the year and have stabilised at RUR 4,600 per sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Financially strong, demand-side companies have fixed profitable commercial terms. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Good news about the macroeconomic situation, in particular, a lower than expected decline in business activity and consumer demand may result in demand already in Q2. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Supply&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;363,000 sq m was delivered to the market in Q1 2015, and the total stock reached 9.151 mln. sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The following buildings were completed: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building 10 in PNK-Severnoe Sheremetievo (65,000 sq m) developed by PNK Group &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1st phase of Sherrizone-Nord warehouse complex (55,000 sq m) by Griffin Partners &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The first building in Logopark Sofyino (developer &amp;ndash; AT Nedvizhimost) with the total area of 92,000 sq m &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Two buildings in South Gate Industrial Park with the total area of 46,000 and 41,000 sq m accordingly &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;359,000 sq m is planned for delivery in Q2 2015. The main part of the expected warehouse space is to be delivered in the southern part of the region where PNK Group is planning to complete a 100,000 sq m warehouse in PNK-Chekhov 3. Another significant contribution to delivery in Q2 will be made by the Kholmogory project in the North-East; this logistics park is being developed by Atlant Capital Partners.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Distribution of new delivery in 2015 is very uneven in terms of timing. About 97% of 2015 completions are to be commissioned in H1 (772,000 of the 794,000 sq m expected for the whole of 2015). The main reason for such a skewing is unprofitable commercial conditions for developers in the medium term. At the same time, construction costs, which dropped significantly due to the Rouble devaluation, have already started recovering as a result of rising inflation. National currency has also been strengthening in February-April 2015. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;At the moment developers are focused on on-going projects and have not announced any new ones for almost a year, which means that in the short term potential occupiers will only be able to choose between existing projects. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Demand&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Take-up in Q1 2015 amounted to 255,000 sq m, which is the same as in the period of 2014 and 30% lower than in the previous quarter. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Along with this, a number of renewal deals were closed on the market, totalling 96,000 sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The largest transaction of the quarter was the BTS-deal between Leroy Merlin and developer Radius Group – according to their agreement, a 100,000 sq m building is to be constructed for the DIY retailer in South Gate Industrial Park. This deal was the only forward-looking deal in Q1. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The rest of demand activity was produced by deals involving the leasing of currently vacant space (40% of space leased was on second-hand premises). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Among significant transactions in Q1 2015 were: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Major Logistics leased 24,000 sq m in Logopark Sever 2 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Distribution company Veles group leased 15,000 sq m in building 7 of PNK-Chekhov 2. The lease agreement was signed with the new owner of the building following the purchase of the building from the developer PNK Group &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Vacancy&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The amount of vacant space reached almost 1 mln. sq m, representing 10.9% of the total stock. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;67% of the 995,000 sq m currently vacant is in newly completed buildings, while 33% is existing, completed space, which became available after tenants had left it. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Another 359,000 sq m of buildings currently nearing completion will come onto the market in Q2 2015, 254,000 sq m of which is available for the market. As a result, the vacancy rate is likely to remain at its current level - higher than 10% - until the end of the Q2. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Commercial terms&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The average rental rate settled at RUR 4,600/sq m/year, and remained stable during the whole of Q1. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The average rental rate for projects under construction is around RUR 4,300/sq m/year, and for existing buildings is RUR 4,800/sq m/year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The expected slowdown of new delivery is beginning to form the fundamental basis for halting the plunge in rental rates and stabilising the current market conditions. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Oxana Fedulova, Associate Director, Research Department in CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The record new delivery in 2014 and new projects of the first half of 2015 formed significant stock of the vacant warehouse space. With the current business activity, the vacancy rate of 10% could become the objective reality in the next couple of quarters. It will go down much more slowly than it increased&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director, Head of Industrial Logistic Agency, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The current situation in the market formed the optimal terms for tenants and buyers: the rental rates are on the minimal level, thus there is a big stock of vacant space available in the market. But this &amp;ldquo;window of opportunities&amp;rdquo; is really short-term. The conditions have formed to fix the rental rates and stop them from going down. The slowly going down vacancy rate together with the lack of new delivery will be pushing the warehouse prices up in the nearest future. There will be no further improvement of achievable commercial terms for tenants.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Emerging markets, particularly in Asia, have continued to dominate the shopping centre development pipeline with over 39 million sq m under construction at the end of last year. China accounted for over 60% of the pipeline, with Russia, Turkey and India also possessing significant space under construction, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Shanghai tops the ranking for most new space under construction with 4.1 million sq m, followed by Shenzhen (3.4 million sq m) and Chengdu in third place with 3 million sq m, Chongqing and Guangzhou make up the top five most active markets with more than 20 projects in the pipeline. However, supply of new development in China and India is at risk of slowing down due to the economy and mounting financial pressures on landlords. Construction of some shopping malls is on hold due to lack of funding or in some cases landlords are considering changing the schemes to other uses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Europe accounted for 20% of total completions in 2014 with Russia and Turkey continuing to dominate the new development pipeline.  Moscow was the most active European megapolis in 2014 and the only city outside of China in the top five.  Notable schemes completed include the AVIAPARK which is currently Europe's largest shopping mall totalling 231, 000 sq m of gross leasable area (GLA). Istanbul saw the addition of eight new shopping centres totalling 440, 253 sq m and also has one of the largest development pipelines in Europe. This has been led by the easy availability of credit in the Turkish market which has fuelled consumer spending. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Middle East, Abu Dhabi continues to strengthen its position as a leading retail destination with the completion of four new centres including the Yas Mall located on Yas Island with space for 400 shops, a 20 screen cinema and 10,000 car parking spaces. Paris was once again the most active market in Western Europe, with only one centre opening in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Natasha Patel, EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The factors driving the development pipeline of new space remains largely unchanged compared to last year in terms of location with new construction dominated by Asia and in particular China. Other influences include a growing middle class population in emerging markets, the urbanisation of large cities and a lack of high quality retail space required by cross border retailers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Western Europe and the U.S. continue to suffer from a lack of new development and extensions and refurbishments of existing centres will be a key focus in a bid to continue to attract key retailers and consumers.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2014 more than 600 thousand sq m of shopping malls with GLA of no less than 20 000 sq m was introduced in Moscow market. By this indicator Moscow market took the 5th place, yielding only a few Chinese cities for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2015 due to influence of economic difficulties, weakening consumer demand and reduction development plans of retailers about 35% of projects that were planned to be commissioned this year will be frozen. Nonetheless, the volume of new delivery in 2015 still amount 550, 000 sq m that suggests that in 2015 Moscow would be in the top five cities with the fastest growing retail market in the world.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Globally, 53 percent of investors plan to increase their purchases this year. Investor appetite for cross-regional acquisitions has increased significantly with 38 percent of respondents intending to invest outside their own region this year–up from 28 percent in 2014. Among these investors, 31 percent identified Western Europe as the top destination. Despite the slowdown in China, 27 percent of investors regarded Asia as their preferred investment destination, with economic growth there still outpacing other regions and continuing to offer significant long-term growth potential. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 London retained its position as the top city for investment, while other gateway cities such as Tokyo, Sydney, New York and Paris remained in the top ten. Second-tier cities saw an increase in investor interest in 2015, with Madrid, Dallas and Seattle all making the top ten. This reflects investors’ search for more attractive yields, as well as greater knowledge and comfort with a larger number of global cities. There is also a marked increase in appetite among investors from Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and North America for value-add and opportunistic investments. In contrast, Asia Pacific saw a significant jump in investors preferring prime core assets at 43 percent in 2015, compared to 29 percent last year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Chris Ludeman, Global President, CORE.XP Capital Markets: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;The appetite for global real estate investment is increasing as more investors intend to deploy capital outside of their own region this year. Competition for assets is intensifying and many investors plan to move out the risk curve in search of higher yields–a trend that will result in a stronger focus on value-add and opportunistic investments. We believe that a low interest rate environment, economic expansion in an increasing number of markets, and corresponding improvement in real estate fundamentals will attract capital to commercial real estate&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Office and industrial remain the preferred asset classes, selected by 33 percent and 29 percent of investors respectively. Investor interest in industrial and logistics assets is being driven by the structural change in the retail sector and the growth of e-commerce; however, there is a limited supply of assets in this sector available for sale, meaning that investors will continue to face challenges when sourcing deals. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Half of respondents identified asset pricing as the top obstacle to acquiring real estate assets. The tight availability of assets (21 percent) and competition from other investors (19 percent) were also identified as obstacles in all regions. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist, CORE.XP: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “The “new normal” economic environment of moderate growth, low interest rates and compressing bond yields continue to drive investment in commercial real estate. We also observe the continuing globalization of the investment market, reflected by the 40 percent y-o-y growth in cross-regional capital flows in 2014–a figure well above the growth rate for the market overall. The survey findings strengthen our view that overall volumes and cross-regional investment will increase in 2015”. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “After low activity in Q4 2015, when investment transactions amounted to just USD 350 mln, the first signs of recovery are appearing. During first 4 months of 2015 investment volumes exceeded USD 700 mln. Given earlier indicated investors’ interest to some properties, this indicator might grow by additional a few hundreds millions USD in May-June. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Acquisitions of commercial space by tenants also indicated noticeable growth. In Q1 owner-occupiers bought more than 40 thous. sqm of office space, which is equivalent to 21% of the volume of new leasing and renegotiations transactions combined. In I&amp;amp;amp;L segment we see owner-occupiers transactions, which are as large as 100 thous. sq m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Increase in investment activity is explained by increasing probability of scenario, in which currently the market is close to its cyclical low. Better than expected dynamics of a number of macroeconomic indicators, as well as noticeable appreciation of Rouble since January 2015, contribute to positive sentiments. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 One should mention that market uncertainty is still pretty high. The risks are associated with still remaining geopolitical issues and possibility to see one more downward wave in oil prices under the influence of, say, perspectives of Iran, coming back to oil market, or world economy, slowing down its growth. High new delivery and its upward pressure on the vacancy remain important risks for office and retail segments. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 However, chances for faster than expected recovery of demand for commercial space increased since the beginning of 2015. Now it is the key decision-making driver for investors, which are ready to take higher risks. Potential of growth in asset price is estimated at 40-50% during the next 2 years, which is very attractive for some players”. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
European hotel investment has seen year-on-year growth of 116% reflecting the strength in hotels as a growing commercial property asset class, this has been led by a number of factors including high investor appetite for consumer driven real estate asset classes in a time of low inflation and rising consumer spending.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hotel investment activity in nearly all European countries was significantly higher in the first quarter (Q1) of 2015 compared to Q1 2014. The UK, France and Germany presented strong growth in Q1 2015 with investment volumes increasing by 38%, 90% and 225% respectively year-on-year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK will continue to see strong trading growth on the back of expected economic growth and limited supply risk. Whilst the German transaction market is likely to remain hot in the coming quarters as the availability of operational leases attracts a growing number of institutional investors at a time of low bond yields. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Southern Europe saw a substantial uptick in transaction volumes across the region in Q1 2015 reaching €878 million and up 301% year-on-year. The increase was largely due to a notable rise in Spanish hotel transactions which has attracted interest from private equity funds who are seeking value-add opportunities with strong growth potential. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Austria has also seen a sizable increase in hotel transactions hitting €160 million in Q1 2015. This is mainly due to a spill-over of capital previously looking at assets in Western Europe, based on attractive yields and healthy trading performance data.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Joe Stather, Information and Intelligence Manager EMEA, CORE.XP Hotels, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The surge in hotel investment volumes indicates the continuing investor appetite in hotels as an asset class. The opportunity for strong returns across the hotel space, coupled with high levels of liquidity will continue to drive transaction levels for the next 12 months in most European markets.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Russian hotel segment is rather popular, but quite complicated investment asset. During the last 5 years investors acquired properties for around $2,35 bn., or roughly $0,5 bn. per annum. Investors were focused on Moscow. There were transactions with both trophy assets and hotel chains, targeting budget clients.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
During first 4 months of 2015 only $15 mln. were invested in hotels. Such a small amount is explained by the risks, which increased as a result of worsened macroeconomic situation. However, from the fundamental point of view, depreciated Rouble made it much cheaper for foreign tourists to travel across Russia. This positive change might fuel investors&amp;rsquo; interest to the hotels, as well as stabilization of geopolitical risks”.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Moscow is the most popular European city that attracts international retail chains &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London &amp;ndash; Moscow 20 May 2015 – Tokyo is the world&amp;rsquo;s hottest city for new retailer expansion, attracting 63 new retail brands, according to the latest report by global property advisor CORE.XP, &amp;ldquo;How Global is the Business of Retail?&amp;rdquo;. Space in core areas of Tokyo remain highly sought after despite the mixed signals in the economy and an increase in sales tax of 8% introduced in April 2014. Singapore follows Tokyo with 58 new retail brands and Abu Dhabi saw the arrival of 55 new retail brands, ranking the city in third place in the top target markets by new retailer entrants. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 London has retained its position as the world’s most international shopping destination with 57.9% of international retailers present there. In 2014 12 new brands opened in the city, including American Eagle and Lululemon Athletics. The UK’s capital city continues to be a magnet for international retailers who want to showcase and establish their brand. London was closely followed by Dubai which has 55.7% of international retailers present and Shanghai with 53.4%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Andrew Phipps, Head of EMEA Retail Research, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “The continued desire for expansion into new cities remains high for international brands and we are seeing a great deal of expansion into Asia and in particular into Tokyo, Singapore and Taipei, whilst, the desire to expand into the Middle East shows no sign of slowing down. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 However, more established markets such as London continue to draw international brands as it attracts a phenomenal amount of international visitors and overseas shoppers making it a truly global shopping destination. It remains key for international brands to have a strong presence in London, fundamentally due to its size, transparency and position on the global retail stage.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Retailer globalisation continued in 2014 as retail brands targeted a wide range of locations across the world. 164 cities were surveyed and half saw at least five new retailers open a store. Asia features heavily on the list of target cities of new retailer entrants with six out of the 15 cities from the region. Moscow and Paris were the only European cities that featured in the top 10 target markets attracting 41 and 40 new entrants respectively. US retailers dominated cross–border expansion and accounted for 26% of expansion into new global markets, whilst Italian retailers were the second most active accounting for 14% followed by UK based retailers with 11%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 41 new international brands entered the Moscow market in 2014. As a result, Moscow is the most popular European city that attracts international retail chains. Also it is the 7th in the world ranking. As of the beginning of 2015, 154 leading international bands from 334 (46%) that activity is regularly tracked by CORE.XP are presented on the Moscow market. By this indicator, Moscow shares the 5th-6th places with Singapore with only 4 cities ahead: London, Dubai, Shanghai and New York. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 During 2015 no more than 15-18 new international players could enter the Moscow market. Substantially, this is a result of negative geopolitical situation in the second part of 2014 that resulted the reviewing development plans of the potential new players. In 2015 interest to the Russian market gradually begin to recover and resulted in the growth of activity of international retail chains in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “In 2015 commercial terms for retailers have improved as well as macroeconomic indicators have decreased less than alive. Positive news like increasing of consumer confidence make good conditions for new financially strong and strategically-thinking brands.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Peter Gold, Head of EMEA Cross Border Retail, CORE.XP added: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “The core elements of globalisation such as technology and demographic changes are continuing to have a dramatic impact on the retail business. As retailers look to drive market share and raise their brand profile, they will continue to expand and look for opportunities beyond their home territories. We are seeing brands open in diverse locations around the world such as Taipei, Doha and Manila which all feature in the top 15 target markets as well as more recognised cities like Paris and Dubai where retailers are opening more stores as these prove successful.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Mid-Range fashion retailers remained the most active sector accounting for 21% of global expansion, followed by Luxury and Business retailers with 20%. Expansion into the EMEA region was dominated by Mid-range fashion brands accounting for 26% of activity, followed by Specialist clothing retailers with 18%. &#13;

Nadezhda Tsvetkova, Associate Director of Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Our company has been successfully working with the developer of this shopping mall. This new shopping-centre will become the landmark not only for Toliatti but for the region as well. Unique location as well as the right concept will attract major international and federal retailers. We have already noticed high interest to this project from anchor tenants and tenants of the shopping gallery. For anchor tenants this shopping mall will help to inforce its position in the region, for the tenants of shopping gallery this will be a great opportunity to open its first shop in the city with the population of over 700,000 people. &amp;rdquo;&#13;

Platform acquisitions and corporate takeovers provide the opportunity to succeed on this strategy and are possibly less competitively priced than traditional single assets and / or smaller portfolios in the market.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s research shows that although interest in CEE commercial real estate is still high, scarcity of available product in certain markets, particularly Poland, is putting some constraints on the amount of investment activity. This lack of stock, however, is resulting in more deal flow into other parts of the region, particularly in the Czech Republic which has seen investment volumes from January to April this year increase to &amp;euro;901 million, compared to €326 million for the same period in 2014. Hungary has also benefitted with €174 million of commercial real estate investment in the first four months of this year (Jan-April 2014: €54 million) and, to a lesser extent the Baltics and Romania.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jos Tromp, CORE.XP’s Head of Central &amp;amp;amp; Eastern Europe and Africa Research, added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Commercial real estate investors continue to look for opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, with an increasing amount of countries in the region benefitting. We believe that this will continue throughout the year as international capital continues its search for return on investment and expands its reach further afield than western and southern Europe. However, actual volumes from year to year may fluctuate as deals tend to be &amp;lsquo;chunky’, for example the Palladium Shopping Centre in the Czech Republic sold for c. €570 million, representing 63% of the country’s total volume. Overall, we believe we will see a further recovery of volumes, in most parts of CEE, on the back of low interest rates and improving economic fundamentals”. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In January - May 2015 investments into Russian commercial real estate market amounted to €650 mln. which is 44% below figures for the same period of 2014. The reasons of this situation are quite simple: geopolitical tensions and excessive volatility of the financial markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investors are focused on the office segment that benefitted from €594 mln. inflow, or more than 90% off all investments in the Russian commercial real estate market. This activity partially explained by the two facts. Firstly, vacancy in this segment almost reached its expected peak level. Secondly, downward potential for rents movement is perceived as relatively small.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Situation in retail property market is more difficult, as the depth of current negative pressure on real wages still remains unclear.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrey Novikov, Managing Director of Capital Markets, СBRE, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The relatively small transaction activity does not mean the absence of investors' interest to the market. Today there are quite a lot of investors, including from not typical regions for the Russian market, analyzing the existing opportunities. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As a result, in H2 2015 we might witness results of this interest in completed transactions. However, geopolitical situation still remains the strong factor, which can ruin these expectations.”&#13;

Spain, Italy, Belgium, Czech Republic and Norway See Greatest Increases&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
UK Continues to Attract Significant and Growing Proportion of Investment&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 9 June 2015 &amp;ndash; According to the latest research from CORE.XP, European commercial real estate investment activity in Q1 2015 totaled just under &amp;euro;55 billion, an increase of 30% compared to the same period in 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Capital Markets, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The first quarter of this year was the highest Q1 total since 2007, when European investment volumes reached €60 billion. It is notable that there has been a significant rise in the number of portfolios being brought to the market, a sign that European commercial real estate is experiencing increased liquidity and investors are starting to seek economies of scale. There is also a growing trend, particularly amongst private equity firms, for platform acquisitions and corporate takeovers. All of these are helping to drive up total activity across the region.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK contributed a substantial proportion (42%) of the growth in investment activity recorded in Q1 2015, helped by the weakness of the euro. Investment in southern Europe also continues to grow strongly. Activity in Spain remains at a very high level, the four quarters to Q1 2015 represent its highest ever 12-month total for investment turnover. Investment in Italy is also continuing to increase, with Q1 2015 turnover of €1.9 billion, 159% higher than in Q1 2014. Portugal too has seen significant growth in investment activity, €218 million in Q1 2015 compared to just €31 million in for the same period in 2014.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investment in Central and Eastern Europe remains somewhat constrained, with political and economic issues around Russia continuing to be an issue for investors. The Czech Republic, however, has been an exception to this trend. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Michael Haddock, Senior Director, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, added: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Despite the fact that CEE showed up as an area of strong interest from global investors in our recent Investor Intentions Survey, the level of activity remains subdued when compared to the long term average. However, in contrast to the regional trend, investment in the Czech Republic has been increasing. Q1 2015 was its third successive total above €800 million, double the country&amp;rsquo;s 10-year average of under €400 million per quarter.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elsewhere in the region, Belgium and Norway (alongside Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic) saw the greatest increases, with both seeing investment volumes 140% higher than their Q1 2014 totals.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In the last few year Russia was claiming to be in top 5 of the most active investment destinations in Europe. In 2014 - 2015 investment activity significantly declined under the influence of geopoiltical issues. Its size in Q1 was smaller than even in some countries of the Eastern Europe, such as Poland and Czech Republic. However, we expect recovery of investors' interest to the Russia commercial real estate assets in the mid-year run. In 2017 investments might exceed €6-7 bl. mark.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand for the best office premises is continuing to rise, with more companies recognising the importance of being located in amenity-rich central locations, close to market peers and in the best properties, in order to attract the most talented employees. While this is a general phenomenon, the London and Madrid office markets demonstrate this particularly well. In the City of London market occupier demand rose by 12% in the first quarter, and the West End experienced its most active start to a year in the last three. Meanwhile, the Spanish capital recorded its strongest first quarter for two years with 125,000 sq m of space acquired by occupiers. Compared to the same period last year, Western Europe has seen total aggregate office take-up grow by 4% year-on-year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The supply of available office space across Europe has been broadly stable since mid-2013, but has now started to show clearer signs of tightening. As a result, and compounded by low levels of development in many cities, prime rents are increasing across Europe. Dublin, for example, has seen a 5.6% increase in the first quarter of this year from &amp;euro;484 to over €510 per sq m per annum. This completes an annual rise of nearly 36%, the strongest across EMEA, which demonstrates its popularity as a prime business location. The strongest quarterly rent increase was posted by Helsinki which rose by 8.8% to €444 per sq m per annum.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton, EMEA Head of Occupier Research, at CORE.XP explains:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Companies understand that to prosper in today&amp;rsquo;s marketplace they need to provide office conditions that reflect the modern employee’s needs. Increasingly, this means centrally located, well-connected, amenity-rich work places that provide a destination space to stimulate collaboration and development. This is one reason why prime rents for the best locations are on an upward trajectory, as such space is coming under increasing pressure. The solid start to this year sets the expectation that a further upswing in the office market is likely for the year ahead.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Market Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Unlike rental rates in other European capitals, rental rates in Moscow office buildings are decreasing: in Q1 2015 they went down by 5-15% compared to Q4 2014 and by 25-45% compared to the beginning of 2014: Prime Class A $850-$1 000, Class A $450-$550, Class B $250-$400 (net base rents excluding service charges and VAT). The decrease of rental rates is taking place under the pressure of decreasing demand and is caused by current geopolitical situation and Rouble devaluation. In the current crisis situation, the demand is concentrated in Class B office buildings located outside of the city centre. In Q1 2015, more than a half of all the deals was signed in the areas between the TTR and MKAD, and 85% of transactions involved Class B properties. The volume of Class A deals is comparable with 2009, the year of the previous financial crisis. In such conditions, a significant part of transactions involves renewals as well as renegotiations of commercial terms.”&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Previously Karcher was dealing with 3pl services worldwide and in Russia in particular.

Moscow Remains One of the 10 world&amp;rsquo;s most expensive office locations&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles &amp;mdash; Moscow, June 24, 2015 — London&amp;rsquo;s West End continued to be the world’s highest-priced office market but Asia dominated the world’s most expensive office locations, accounting for four of the top five markets, according to CORE.XP Research’s semi-annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs survey. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The study also found that the real estate recovery in the Emerald Isle (Ireland) remained on track, with Dublin (26.1 percent) and Belfast (13.3 percent) showing the largest and fourth-largest year-over-year prime occupancy cost increases, respectively among the 127 cities surveyed. In North America real estate fundamentals remained strong with Seattle (Downtown), San Francisco (Peninsula) and Vancouver (Suburban) among the 10 markets with the fastest growing prime occupancy costs. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London West End’s overall prime occupancy costs of US$267 per sq. ft. per year topped the &amp;ldquo;most expensive&amp;rdquo; list. Hong Kong (Central) followed with total prime occupancy costs of US$254 per sq. ft., Beijing (Finance Street) (US$196 per sq. ft.), Beijing (Central Business District (CBD)) (US$188 per sq. ft.) and New Delhi (Connaught Place &amp;ndash;CBD) (US$157 per sq. ft.) rounded out the top five. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The change in prime office occupancy costs mirrored the gradual recovery of the global economy. Global prime office occupancy costs rose 2.0 percent year-over-year, with the Americas up 2.9 percent, EMEA rising 1.5 percent and Asia Pacific up 1.4 percent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Occupier caution has declined and corporate confidence has been on the rise and this confidence is starting to translate into a degree of expansionary momentum,“ said Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist, CORE.XP. “At the same time, many office markets are increasingly short of the quality, modern, flexible and highly accessible or CBD-located office buildings which corporations are seeking to execute workplace strategies that will drive productivity and attract or retain talent.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP tracks occupancy costs for prime office space in 127 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 19 were in EMEA, 20 were in Asia Pacific and 11 were in the Americas. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The continued recovery has led to a revival in leasing activity beyond London and Dublin to UK regional cities and smaller Central and Eastern European markets. The exceptions have been Russian office markets, where Western sanctions and the steep drop in oil prices have led to a deep recession, and Warsaw, where supply levels continue to exert downward pressure on rents. In EMEA, occupiers are starting to switch from cost optimization and space reduction to expansions. Prime office occupancy costs increased by 1.5 percent, as only 11 out of 57 EMEA markets saw a year-over-year decline in occupancy costs. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition to London West End, other markets from the region on the global top 10 list are London City (US$143 per sq. ft.) and Moscow (US$128 per sq. ft.). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Claudia Chistova, Head of Office Market Research, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In spite of a significant decrease in rental rates for office space, Moscow continues to be one of the world’s ten most expensive cities. Nevertheless, compared to mid-2014, Moscow dropped four spots in the latest rankings, from number 5 to number 9. Thus, as a result of Q1 2015, the Prime Class A rents equaled $850 – 1 000 sq m per annum (VAT and OpEx not included), demonstrating substantial resilience and a decrease of only 0—5 % compared to the end of 2014 and 15—20 % compared to the beginning of the year. Rents, particularly for properties in the Prime A market segment, are under pressure due to the extremely limited level of demand for such space. For instance, in Q1 2015, deals done in the Prime A segment (new leases, lease renewals and renegotiations) totaled 14 000 sq. m. —6% of the total activity in the market. New lease agreements for Prime A office space amounted to 5 000 sq. m. —5% of the total. Such a modest figure is not surprising in the current market situation, since the main source of demand for Prime A office space comes from international companies, which prefer to renegotiate the commercial terms in their current lease agreements.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Asia Pacific had 20 markets ranked in the top 50 most expensive, including six of the top 10—Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Beijing (CBD), New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD), Hong Kong (West Kowloon) and Tokyo (Marunouchi Otemachi). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Occupancy costs trends were mixed, with regional surveys showing stronger hiring intentions among employers in India, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Philippines and Japan while corporate hiring activity remained muted in other locations. India and the Philippines continued to benefit from growing IT back office services looking for operational and costs efficiency. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong (Central) remained the only market in the world—other than London’s West End—with a prime occupancy cost exceeding US$200 per sq. ft. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$88 per sq. ft.), in 24th place. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

In the U.S., the general economic recovery has boosted demand for office space across most metros despite structural shifts, of which the reduction of space per worker is the most important. Overall, occupier activity has sustained last year’s momentum, leading to an increase in occupancy costs in 19 out of 22 U.S. markets covered in this survey. The fall in the price of oil has impacted Canada leading to 2015 GDP forecast downgrades. Most Latin American economies continued to perform below trend resulting in weak occupational activity. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Four American markets recorded double-digit increases in prime occupancy costs in Q1 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New York Midtown, the 10th most expensive market in the world, remained the most expensive Americas market, with a prime office occupancy cost of US$127 per sq. ft. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rio de Janeiro remained the most expensive market in Latin America, posting an office occupancy cost of US$76 per sq. ft. and ranking as the 31st most expensive market globally. &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Q2 2015 delivered a positive surprise for the market participants: 13 new international brands entered the market in order to leverage on new opportunities. They were driven by significantly improved achievable commercial terms and much richer choice of available options to lease retail space. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;As a result, total number of H1 newcomers reached 17, the figure, which already exceeds forecasts for the whole 2015, developed in the beginning of the current year. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;8 of the new entrants are international retailers, working in premium price segment: Eichholtz, Moreschi, Rocco P., Rouge B. Rouge, Santa Maria Novella, Serge Lutens, Silver Cross, Tsumori Chisato.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

Now the prospects of a Greek default look very high and the chance of a Grexit much closer. The talk is whether we are approaching a Lehman-type event (or even a &amp;ldquo;Sarajevo moment&amp;rdquo; to quote a UK economics editor) or if it is just the latest episode in a largely domestic Greek tragedy. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The next debt payment to the IMF is due tomorrow and Greece will be unable to make it, so a technical default looks certain which will turn into a full-on default if there is a “no” vote on Sunday. The more immediate problem, however, is the liquidity of the Greek banks. In the face of large-scale capital flight over the past 6 months, it has only been Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) from the ECB that has kept Greek banks functioning. The ECB has said that it will freeze the amount available at the &amp;euro;89bn which was agreed last week and that no more will be forthcoming. It is not clear how much of the €89bn is left, but it is unlikely to be enough to allow the banks to satisfy their depositors’ demands for very long and, as a result, the Greek government has had to announce a seven day “bank holiday” and a €60 per day limit on withdrawals from ATMs. This could be particularly problematic for a cash dependent country like Greece particularly if informal sources of credit dry up because of the uncertainty of the situation. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 So, if the first to suffer is the Greek economy itself, what are the chances of this becoming a Lehman, or even a Sarajevo moment? In strict terms, where credit markets freeze because no one knows who is solvent and who is not, we are not looking at a Lehman moment. Unlike in 2011-12 where this was a real danger, most of the Greek debt is now on national governments’ or inter-governmental organisations’ and not private banks’ balance sheets. This does not mean that a hit of €56bn for the German government, for example, will not smart but there was never any chance of the creditors getting their money back in a hurry no matter what deal was agreed. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Rather than a downwards spiral of bank credit or financing problems for Greece’s creditors, the main issue, other than short-term uncertainty, is the potential Pandora’s Box effect of a country leaving what was meant to be an irrevocable monetary union. If a Grexit happens, the concern is that markets will turn their attention to the bond markets of some of the other weaker members of the Eurozone when signs of economic or financial stress appear or that, they too, could see Greek style runs on their banks. The big positive here is that the ECB quantitative easing mandate (reinforced by the recent European Court of Justice ruling on its legitimacy and scope) gives it far greater flexibility to stabilise bank markets and the ELA facility stands ready to respond to any potential bank runs. In addition, the public finances of some of the peripheral Eurozone economies, particularly Spain and Ireland, are in much better shape than they were in 2011-12 (Spain and Ireland look likely to be the fastest growing Western European economies in 2015). The markets’ concerns, or otherwise, will soon show up in sovereign bond yield spreads. As of Friday, they were still very relaxed. The spread of yields of most southern European bonds over German bunds actually came in over the course of last week; so the next few days could be a whole new ball game and already this morning the yield on German bunds has fallen about 20bps (a flight to quality effect) while yields on Spanish, Portuguese and Italian bonds are up 25bps. Reassuringly, yields on French bonds have also fallen which helps to assuage concern that the markets would also see France as a country at danger in a re-run of the 2011-12 European sovereign debt crisis. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The problem with the uncertainty over the situation is that it is difficult to say when it will end. Organising a referendum within such a short time frame is ambitious but it will still leave a void for a week. Even after the referendum results are in, it is unclear what will happen. The answer will be either a simple “yes” or “no” to the creditors’ proposals rather than a clear “yes and stay in the euro” or “no and leave the euro”, therefore the crisis could still drag on for weeks or months. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 A “no” vote (no to the creditors’ proposals) means an almost certain Grexit. This would involve the introduction of a new Drachma, ongoing capital controls (on hard currencies at least), and high inflation for a while as a result of devaluation. Ironically, the high inflation would depress the real incomes of state employees and pensioners &amp;ndash; the exact same groups that the Greek government has sought to protect throughout the negotiations. Longer term, devaluation, followed by continued fiscal restraint could produce a newly competitive Greek economy where growth is able to resume. Policies that aim to offset the impact of high inflation on real incomes by increasing state benefits and wages, however, would threaten hyperinflation and a continuance of the crisis. Interestingly, a “no” vote with a successful devaluation and return to competitiveness could pose the biggest long-term contagion threat if markets and indebted peripheral Eurozone countries see that that there is a prosperous life outside of the euro area. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 What happens with a “yes” vote is a little clearer. The Syriza government will resign rather than go beyond its “red lines” on spending cuts but there would be a while before a new General Election. Eventually, the result might be the election of a more moderate government that is prepared to do business with Greece’s creditors. This, in turn, might be rewarded with a more conciliatory attitude from the creditors which leads to a more balanced deal that offers some element of debt forgiveness in exchange for further spending cuts. All of this is still highly uncertain although, under such circumstances, there would be a very good chance that the ECB would relent and increase its ELA limit which would at least enable the banks to function properly again. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Concerns over the weekend’s developments and over the results of next Sunday’s poll have already been seen through early falls in equity prices and it looks like being a volatile week, or longer, for stock markets. An immediate impact for all investors, real estate and others, will be that capital controls will make it difficult, if not impossible, for foreign investors to repatriate income from Greece. As far as the broader impact on European real estate is concerned, if the big downside risks do not materialise, we may see some reticence in decision making and a slowdown in deal volumes over the summer (where business is usually slow anyway) and then a bounceback which could be quite rapid if Syriza loses the election. If there is a Grexit with an ongoing contagion crisis, however, there is a danger of a major drop in investor confidence with prime yields rising (though a flight to quality could have the opposite effect in some markets) and prime-secondary yield spreads moving out. Corporate confidence would also be hit with capital investment and leasing decisions put on hold and a fall in consumer confidence could hit retail. Eventually, new investment opportunities in Greece may open up but they could be a long time coming. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 At present, we are closer to the “downside scenario” than we were but we are not there yet. However, we will be watching the markets over the coming days and weeks keenly to see how market and policy reactions develop. &#13;

CORE.XP sees its major task to attract new brands to the project which are to increase its tenant-mix .  &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the new research by CORE.XP, starting from Q4 2014 purchasing power suffered from the ruble depreciation, that exceeded 40% and followed inflation. As a result a lot of retail chains have to cut or optimize their development plans, so in many projects we see the major vacancy growth. The penetration rate in Moscow and in the Russian regions reached its historic maximum in 8 years and is 9%. It is possible that this ratio can reach 11- 12%. This number could be explained by the major technical openings of the shopping malls that are usually pre-leased by 25-30% by the time of their grand opening.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite this challenging situation in the Russian retail market , the vacancy rate in Madagascar shopping and entertainment centre in Cheboksary is less than 2%. The shopping centre was opened in April 2012 and the number of visitors today is 25-30,000 people. In order to stop increasing vacancy and to support the image of a shopping mall as well as to keep the number of visitors and turnover the management company of Madagascar plans to optimize the concept of the shopping centre.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s retail team has a long-term successful co-operation with Madagascar shopping mall. Over 95% of premises were leased by the time it was opened and many retail chains opened their first stores in the region there.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;I am really happy that after 3 years after the grand opening of Madagascar shopping and entertainment centre our team was chosen again to lease free retail space.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The views of 22,000 consumers in 22 countries across EMEA showed that 41% preferred to eat in shopping centres compared to 10% in restaurants and caf&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s on the high street, and 7% in retail parks.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A third of those interviewed visited shopping centres with the sole intention of eating or drinking. Four out of ten then went on to shop even if their reason for visiting the centre was just to eat or drink.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
90% of those surveyed in UAE and 86% in South Africa rated the availability of food and beverage important with over half (57% in UAE and 65% in South Africa) almost always ending up visiting shops even when food and beverage is the reason for being there. Slightly behind the UAE and South Africa were the views of those in the UK – 65% rated the availability of food and beverage important, while just under half (47%) would end up visiting the shops afterwards. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;It is clear that the presence of a compelling food and beverage offer is key to driving footfall and revenue to a shopping centre. The days have gone when a limited fast food offer or a drab food court was sufficient reason to visit. Now they are a draw themselves and the lure of a well conceived and excellently delivered eating and drinking experience is what really gets consumers excited.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The conducted survey one more time confirmed the high importance of a quality food-court as a factor, contributing to increase a number of visitors in any shopping mall. It still keeps its role as a significant component of people’s needs for pleasure from “purchases, entertainment, joint meal” while visiting one place. Nonetheless, shopping malls owners seem to underestimate the importance of a food-court. And quality of its tenants’ operations is steadily worsening quite often. In addition, shopping centres management companies are also often not aware of this problem, associating growing problems with attendance with general worsening of economic conjuncture.”  &#13;

Although the rate of year-on-year growth in investment activity has slowed slightly compared with Q1, it is still the highest Q2 total since 2007. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

Spain, Portugal, Finland and Norway experienced an exceptional increase in investment levels, each more than doubling on Q2 2014. Germany also had a strong quarter with investment of €12 billion, up 62% on Q2 2014. &#13;

Although the overall market remains active, a lack of product, rather than a lack of demand, is causing markets in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to show relatively low levels of investment, particularly in the retail and industrial sectors.

“In recent months we have seen the market trying to balance a lack of stock with the large amount of capital available for investment. This has generated a significant amount of activity in the portfolio sector, and in Q2 we again saw an increase in corporate deals such as Merlin Properties&amp;rsquo; recent acquisition of Spanish property company Testa for around €1.8 billion.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investments into Russian commercial real estate in H1 2015 amounted to USD 1,088.3 mln. This is 31% less compared to the same period of 2014. However, it is worth mentioning that the difference between these two figures is explained by one transaction: exchange of assets between Moscow government and VTB (VTB acquired Moscow Hotel Company). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As it was in 2009-2010, investors are focused on the office segments: USD 770 mln., or 71% of total. The most interesting Q2 offices deals include sales of Mercedes-Benz Plaza and office building on Bakhrushina 32-34. Both deals occurred in Moscow. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Regional transactions amounted to just 2,6% of total H1 2015 volumes. This activity occurred in Saint-Petersburg. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest chunk of investments in the industrial and logistics segment is related to the deal between PNK Group and the structures of BIN Group. The latter acquired logistics park PNK-Chekhov. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
By amount of investment transactions, H1 2015 became the 2nd active period in 2011-2015 after H1 2013. Office segment witnessed 13 transactions.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Cross-border investors did not make any acquisition of Russian commercial real estate in Q2 2015. As a result, the H1 share of local investors increased up to 69%. This level is pretty standard one for Russian market after the crisis of 2008-2009.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In H1 2015 cross-border investor acquired properties on USD 341 mln., sold – on USD 277,1 mln. Thus, net inflow of foreign investments amounted to USD 64 mln. &#13;

Andrey Novikov, Managing Director, Capital Markets, CORE.XP, Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Even though, the results of this quarter are below the figures of Q2 last year, certain increase of activity is observed in the market. Significant share of total volumes (over 70%) is invested in office segment that can be explained by reaching &amp;lsquo;cyclical extremes’ in Q1 2015 by this sector - vacancy rate has almost reached its peak, and its growth rate is slowing down, while rental rates have stabilized. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This stimulates higher volumes of investment activity, even though risks, related to geopolitical situation and oil prices, are still in place”. &#13;

Rental Growth Remains Uneven, Strongest In Retail Sector&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>text</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 27 July 2015 &amp;ndash; European commercial real estate markets saw further yield contraction in Q2 2015 across all property sectors, reflecting growing investor demand and very low bond yields, according to the EMEA Prime Rents and Yields survey from global property advisor CORE.XP. Across the total of 163 sector/city combinations throughout the EMEA region, none saw any increase in prime yields over the quarter.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime yields fell across all main sectors, to stand at least 30 basis points lower than they were a year ago. The second quarter alone saw yields narrowing by at least ten basis points across all the main commercial sectors, and by as much as 15 basis points in the industrial and logistics sector. This reflected significant adjustments in some of the major hubs including Paris, Barcelona and Milan. Office yields contracted in a number of major markets including London, Munich, Brussels and Paris while several important retail centres also saw yields shifts, including Dublin, Berlin and Milan.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental movements remain patchy, with the sector rental indices rising marginally, although more strongly in the retail sector. Notable rent rises over the quarter include the office markets in Dublin, Barcelona and the City of London; as well as the retail sectors in Milan, Rome and Prague.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research at CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;There has been some recent volatility in European bond yields associated with concerns over Greece and the perception of a possible knock-on effect for a small number of countries in the region. Despite this, spreads between bond and real estate yields remain at very high levels, as does investment demand for real estate, so we expect the downward pressure on prime yields to persist. Evidence of rental momentum, which would further accentuate the downward trajectory in yields, remains limited but is expected to become more widespread over the coming months&amp;rdquo;.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;YIELDS&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Office yields across EMEA fell in Q2 2015. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index fell by 13 bps in the quarter, and is now 35 bps lower than a year ago. Twenty eight of the 58 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter, thirty remained unchanged and none rose. The single largest fall was recorded in Brussels, where yields contracted by 50 basis points, while a number of other major office markets saw smaller declines, including London, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Stockholm and Milan.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retail yields also moved lower in Q2 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail Yield Index down by 13 bps, and the corresponding Prime Shopping Centre Yield Index down by ten bps, leaving them respectively 42 bps and 34 bps lower than a year ago. Yields fell in 25 of the 54 locations, and remained stable in the remaining 29. The largest changes occurred in Brussels and Lisbon, both down by 50 basis points. Other major retail markets to see downward movements included Milan, Stockholm, Dublin and Berlin.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Industrial yields fell in Q2 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Yield Index down by 15 bps in the quarter, and 54 bps over the year. Yields fell in 26 locations, and remained stable in the remaining 25. There were 50 bps yield shifts in Copenhagen, Bucharest and Edinburgh, and 25bps falls in a number of markets including Paris, Milan, Barcelona and Manchester.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;RENTS&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime office rents across Europe rose slightly in Q2 2015, up by 0.4% in the quarter and 2.1% year-on-year. Office rents rose in eleven locations, fell in three and remained static in the remaining 44. Among the major markets the, most significant increases was in Dublin and Barcelona (both up over 5%). Berlin, Stockholm and the City of London also rose. The largest fall was in Zurich (-3.0%) with Moscow and Zagreb also declining.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime retail rents rose in Q2 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail index up 2.9% in the quarter and the Shopping Centre Rent index up by 1.8% in the quarter. Retail rents rose in eleven locations, fell in three and remained static in the remaining 40. The largest rise was recorded in Rome (12.5%). Milan, Prague and Oslo also recorded increases. Of the three locations to have declined, Moscow was the most significant, down by 8.1% in the quarter.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime industrial rents rose in Q2 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up by 1.0% in the quarter, and 1.2% in year-on-year terms. Nine of the 51 sample locations rose, two fell and the remaining 40 stayed unchanged. The largest increases were recorded in the UK, with London and Edinburgh both up by over 7%. Zurich, Milan and Helsinki also saw increases, while Gothenburg and Kyiv were the two fallers.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Continuation of a trend on decline of yields of European commercial real estate is a logical result of low interest rates on bonds. Current spread between these two assets is very attractive for investors in fixed income instruments. It is worth mentioning, that risks of this kind of investments are increasing along with growing probability of growth of interest rates in the USA and possible slowdown in Chinese economy. Both factor might add negative impact on the European CRE market. However, rental rates in Europe are slightly increasing, reflecting occupiers&amp;rsquo; confidence in capability of European economy to overcome current difficulties. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Russia current yields of prime properties are: in offices – 9,5 – 10%, in retail – 9,75 – 10,25%, in I&amp;amp;amp;L – 12,5-13%. It is to large extent explained by faster decline in asset prices influenced by high vacancy and relatively weak demand. Current spread between investments in Russian CRE market and Eurobonds is comparable to the same indicator of the European markets (450 – 800 basis points). Thus, current yield is not a key argument to invest in Russia.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the next 2-3 years potential of growth in asset prices is estimated at 40-50%, driven by recovery after the current crisis. This is the key argument for current investors in the Russian CRE market. Risks are still quite high, but a number of investors is already ready to buy. Investment volumes are growing 2 quarters in a row. Cross border investors also participate: for example, recent acquisition of Metropolis Business center by American Hines or Czech PPF Group.” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Private Investors Emerge as Major New Source of Outbound Capital&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow, August 5, 2015 &amp;ndash; An average of $15.0 billion per year will flow out of the Middle East into direct real estate globally in the near term, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP Group, Inc.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Middle East continues to be one of the most important sources of cross-regional capital into the global real estate market, with US$14.0 billion invested outside of the home region in 2014&amp;mdash;the third largest source of capital globally. Qatar, driven by its sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), was by far the largest source of outbound capital with US$4.9 billion invested. Saudi Arabia has emerged as a significant new source of capital globally, investing US$2.3 billion in 2014, up from almost no reported investment in 2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Middle Eastern investor base has expanded, fueled by weakening oil prices; this has led to a major shift in global investment strategies towards greater geographic and sector diversification, with activity spreading across gateway markets to second-tier locations in Europe and the Americas. A greater proportion of Middle Eastern capital is now targeting the U.S.—the US$5.0 billion invested globally in Q1 2015 was almost equally split between Europe and Americas, with New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Atlanta targeted. London, while retaining the top position, is no longer as dominant, with a 32 per cent share of all Middle East outbound investment in 2014, compared to 45 per cent in 2013. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Middle Eastern investors are becoming more active across a wider range of sectors. This is clearly evident in the U.S. where, historically, these investors have bought office buildings and trophy hotels in New York, Los Angeles and other gateway markets. Competition from Chinese investors and other global capital sources means that these investors are increasingly seeking alternatives, such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority&amp;rsquo;s $725 million acquisition this year of a 14.2 million-sq.-ft. industrial portfolio.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
	&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Private, non-institutional investors (property companies, high net worth individuals (HNWI), equity funds and any other form of private capital) have emerged as a major and increasing source of outbound capital from the Middle East. With a greater allocation to real estate and more concentration on geographical diversification away from the home region, the potential for non-institutional investors to expand their global real estate acquisitions is of growing importance. This growing trend has had a significant impact on Europe—where their combined real estate investments grew by 56 per cent year-on-year to $4.8 billion—creating a shift in the balance between institutional investors and non-institutional. Non-institutional capital accounts for close to 60 per cent of the total Middle Eastern investment in Europe in 2014.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Weaker oil prices are a strong contributing factor to the growth of non-institutional investment from the Middle East, triggering and accelerating global deployment of capital, with value-add investments in high demand. CORE.XP forecasts that global real estate investment by non-institutional capital from the Middle East will range from US$6.0 to $7.0 billion per annum in the near-term, if not higher, increasing from approximately US$5.0 billion per year during 2010 to 2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Private capital from the Middle East is once again becoming a measurably more important investor group globally. The most immediate change will bring down the average lot size, as non-institutional investors tend to target assets at circa US$50.0 million. This extends naturally to a more diverse investment strategy—a trend already felt in the market so far in 2015 and is expected to become more pronounced in the next 6-18 months. In particular, we expect the Americas region to see more capital flows from the Middle East, with Europe less dominant than it has been over the last five years,&amp;rdquo; said Chris Ludeman, Global President, CORE.XP Capital Markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition to private capital, SWFs from the Middle East are also expected to remain important market-makers, albeit not as strong in their acquisition strategies as they would have been if oil prices had not fallen. It is very unlikely that regional governments will make radical decisions to affect the existing capital allocations, with only new allocations likely to be affected. CORE.XP expects US$7.0 to $9.0 billion per annum of Middle Eastern SWF investment to flow into direct global real estate in the near- to mid-term, compared to what would have otherwise been in the range of US$9.0 to $11.0 billion per annum had oil prices remained at levels above $100 per barrel.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The Middle East will remain one of the most important sources of cross-regional capital in the global real estate market. Recent signs that the Middle Eastern investor base is maturing and becoming more complex in nature are a healthy attribute not only in the context of global real estate, but also for the development of local markets in the Middle East. However, as a significant proportion of wealth accumulated in the Middle East will continue to be natural resource driven, diversification, and global diversification in particular, will be the key to Middle Eastern investors’ future strategies,” said Iryna Pylypchuk, Global Research, CORE.XP.&#13;

Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In January – July 2015 $1,4 bn. were invested into Russian commercial real estate. This is 35% less compared to the same period of 2014. Cross border investors’ activity amounted to $531 mln., or 38% of the total. Share of cross border investors in the total investment volume at 30-40% is a new normality after the crisis of 2008-2009. All foreign investments were delivered by companies from the USA, Czech Republic and Switzerland. After landmark acquisition of townhouse complex “Pokrovskiye Hills” in July 2014, Middle East investors did not close any transactions in Russia. Nonetheless, their interest to the Russian commercial real estate market is still vital. Gradual stabilization of the commercial real estate market creates prerequisites for the new investment transactions. However, unfortunately, high volatility of Russian Rouble exchange rate remains a very strong factor, making investment decisions difficult.”  &#13;

In Europe’s major cities, office development is not keeping pace with growing demand driven by improving employment trends and almost all key office markets are expected to show falling vacancy rates and accelerated rental growth over the next five years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Neil Blake, Head of EMEA Research, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Recent events surrounding Greek debt re-negotiations have obscured what has become a sustained, if uneven, recovery in European economies and this is starting to feed through to Europe’s big office occupier markets. In many cities, office development is not keeping pace with growing demand and almost all major office markets are expected to show falling vacancy rates and rental growth over the next five years, driven by employment growth. &amp;lsquo;Recovering’ cities dominate the employment growth tables for the next five years as corporate confidence grows and expansion plans are executed. As a result a period of sustained rental growth is expected in most markets.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Office-based employment in major cities is increasing at approximately double the growth rate of total employment across Europe. The cities forecast to experience the fastest growth in office-based employment over the next five years are Istanbul, Warsaw, Madrid, Barcelona, London, Lisbon and Bucharest. Istanbul remains at the top of the employment growth league despite potential short-term economic and political instability due to the longer-term growth forecasts for Turkey’s economy. &#13;

While almost all major office markets are forecast to report rental growth, in cities such as Warsaw, Istanbul and Prague, recent development activity and new stock coming on stream will soften rental growth prospects considerably. London and Dublin, which are currently experiencing the fastest rental growth, are also major markets that are responding to demand with increased development. This may lead to rental growth moderating and possibly even easing back towards the end of 2020. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The aggregate vacancy rate for major cities has already fallen from a peak of 9.6% at the end of 2010 to 8.9% now. By mid-2016, CORE.XP expects this to reduce to 8.4% (equivalent to June 2009 levels) with a further fall to 8.1% forecast by the end of 2020, a 10-year low. Falling vacancy will be accompanied by a pick-up in leasing activity. Taking 2015 and 2016 together, leasing volumes are forecast to expand by almost 12% in Europe’s major cities with an increase of 20% in Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, Vienna, Brussels and Warsaw. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
High vacancy rates will persist in cities such as Amsterdam, Budapest, Dublin, Madrid, Prague and Warsaw. However, rental growth is still expected in these markets as empty stock becomes economically redundant due to outdated design or location issues. Vacancy rates in London will actually be higher in five years’ time than they are now as new buildings come on stream.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
If geopolitical relationships stabilize, Moscow is set to be the best performing prime market by the end of 2020. Moscow’s anticipated rebound follows sharp falls seen in 2014 and is predicated on at least a partial easing of economic sanctions and recovery in oil prices to more than $80 a barrel by 2020.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Moscow’s office market also has challenges from rents being set in US dollars, while tenant earnings are largely in (now devalued) rubles. There is evidence (CORE.XP Landlord Survey) that landlords are willing to mitigate the problem by allowing “rental holidays” although they remain resistant to setting future rents in rubles rather than dollars. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental growth is forecast to be strongest in Madrid, Barcelona and Moscow (with caveats) with an expected increase of over 4% p.a over the five years to end Q3 2020. Prime office rents in Madrid are currently &amp;euro;306 psm, up 4.1% from their low point a year ago. They are expected to reach €321.3 psm by March 2016 and €441.8 psm by the end of 2020.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Neil Blake added: “The positive economic backdrop and employment picture means that nearly all European office markets are forecast to report improved returns for investors in office properties. The extent of optimism around the recovery can be seen in the fact that we expect London, one of the lowest yielding markets, to see a further 50bps drop in yields over the next year. However, over the next five years we expect greatest returns to occur in markets such as Budapest, Rome, Madrid and Milan as well as Moscow.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Political risk is the greatest issue for market outlook over the next few years. From Russia/Ukraine to Greece, and the outcome of the Spanish elections, ongoing growth could be jeopardised on a number of fronts. However longer term volatility in equity and bond markets is unlikely and we see no reason for sustained impact on property markets in the rest of Europe.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Improvement in forecasts of key indicators for European office markets is the result of expected medium term acceleration of economic growth in Eurozone. In majority of European business cities new delivery of office space was constrained by unstable economic situation. In addition, business districts there, are already well established and have quite limited space for new development. It means that Europe is close to a new cycle of investors’ interest to the commercial real estate. Nonetheless, the risks of cancellation of this scenario are still noticeable and related to economic problems of the weakest countries and geopolitical issues.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Russia 30-40% decline in rental rates occurred in just 1.5 years due to the more than 2 times decrease of oil prices and consequences of geopolitical issues. Elimination of any of these factors is in position to start rather fast process of rental rates recovery to the pre-crisis levels. As a result, potential for rental rates growth in Russia seems to be one of the strongest in Europe. However, timing of realization of this potential remains fairly uncertain due to the negative trend in oil prices and lack of positive progress in resolution of geopolitical issues.”  &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Eastern European markets continue to lead shopping centre development with 60% of space under construction located in Russia and Turkey, reports leading property advisor CORE.XP. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;During H1 2015, the total amount of new shopping centre space completed across Europe stands at 1.36 million sq m and just under 12 million sq m under construction, with Russia responsible for over half of completions. Russia and Turkey have a combined total of 7.18 million sq m of shopping centre space under construction. Activity in Turkey has been driven by an increasing affluent young population, whilst Russia benefits from a number of cities with large middle class populations.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;However, the overall levels of completions and space in the pipeline are starting to decrease due to a slowdown in Russia and Turkey. The scale of Russian and Turkish development naturally impacts the overall level of construction in Europe due to the large volume of space under construction in these markets. Turkey&amp;rsquo;s shopping centre market has gone hand in hand with the country’s economic growth &amp;ndash; with 81% of Turkey’s entire stock delivered in the last decade. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In H1 2015, the number of completions in Turkey began to dramatically slow down with only 84,200 sq m in gross leasable area resulting in approximately only 11% of the planned new openings for the first half of the year being actualised as scheduled. In most cases, the current economic climate has seen the delivery dates of many projects strategically extended until Q4 in line with the forecast stabilisation of the Lira towards year end. Nevertheless, the elevated retail density in many urban catchments has left only marginal room for further new development. This has seen a marked decrease in dedicated retail developments and even a reduction in the allocated construction ratio, and resulting configuration, of retail in mixed use schemes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Russia a number of schemes have been coming to market with large volumes of vacant space due to slow down in demand from retailers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Natasha Patel, Associate Director, EMEA Retail Research, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;In Russia although there is a great deal of space under construction, a large proportion is being delivered to the market with significant levels of vacant space through “technical openings&amp;rdquo; where the centre opens for trading with between 30-70% vacancy. Vacancy rates have been reduced in the last few months by the willingness of landlords to be flexible when negotiating lease terms.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elsewhere in Europe, levels of construction remain largely unchanged which is ongoing across the board. Within Western Europe, France (704,451 sq m), Italy (485,500 sq m) and Germany (332,700 sq m) have the largest pipeline of space under construction. Development activity within Italy is gradually improving with a number of schemes moving from being on hold or in planning, to under construction. Western Europe continues to be characterised by a large deal of extensions and refurbishments to existing schemes as a way of revitalising existing centres.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Germany, planning permission for  large-scale retail is hard to achieve, since there are already significant developments. Due to this restriction there will be limited development in city centers and virtually none out of town.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Maxim Palt, Senior Consultant of Research Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Out of more than 4 million sq. m of retail space under construction, 1/3 accounts for Moscow and Moscow region and 2/3 for the regional cities. Due to influence of economic difficulties, weakening consumer demand and reduction development plans of retailers, new delivery in Russia will be 15-20% below the historic highs in 2015-2017. In the case of deepening economic recession and its continuation in 2016, the volume of new supply may be reduced by 35-50%. The strongest decrease of new delivery will be reduction in small towns with less than 500,000 inhabitants - new supply in these locations will be 66% below the amount seen last year. As part of the positive scenario of improving economic activity in Russia in 2016, new delivery in such cities can increase by 80-100% and remain on the high level during the next years.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investor appetite has strengthened with H1 European hotel deal volumes reaching €10.73 billion, 85% of the total level seen in 2014; a €4.77 billion and 80% increase year-on-year. Last quarter alone (Q2), transactions reached €5,709 million, up 39% on the same quarter last year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Joe Stather, Information and Intelligence Manager EMEA, CORE.XP Hotels, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Taking into consideration the figures to date, pipeline of activity and historical deal trends, we are set for a record breaking year. The €20 billion threshold seems within reach and would set an unprecedented benchmark for European hotel investment; a realisation that the asset class is becoming progressively mainstream.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The institutional appetite to invest in core real estate has heightened considerably thanks to low interest rates and the associated impact on bond yields. Countries where the hotel landscape was considered to be further along in the cycle, such as Germany, France and the UK, continue to register mounting deal volumes, attracting significant institutional interest and a growing weight of Asian capital.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK investment market remains popular with traditional investors as well as new entrants. At €2,693 million, the Q2 deal volume for the UK exceeded the long-run quarterly average by over €2 billion. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
North American opportunistic capital having targeted Spain&amp;rsquo;s economic recovery is now also contributing to a rise in Italian deal volumes (currently €236 million), €148 million above the long-term quarterly average. Most of the interest has registered in strong tourism locations such as Venice and Rome where robust trading performance has been underpinned by increasingly mobile North American, Northern European and Asian travel markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite a relatively slower second quarter, Irelands H1 deal volume is already €442 million ahead of the total transaction volumes achieved in 2014. Irish hotel deals that seemingly monopolised the headlines over the last 24 months have centred around non-performing debt – some of these assets are now coming back to market as equity and thus making a mark on the country’s investment volume.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Yields continue to strengthen across most European markets and while confidence remains in trading performance growth, assets encumbered by a franchise agreement are achieving lower yields than those operated under a generally less-flexible management contract.&#13;

Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“During 2011-2014 a number of landmark Moscow hotels got new owners. Given the length of investment cycle in this segment and current economic situation in Russia, there is no surprise in the fact that investments in this segment in 2015 were negligible: just $15 mln. Nonetheless, this does not mean low interest to the segment. Nowadays investors’ interest is realized primarily in the new development projects, including these regional. Significant Rouble depreciation made Russia much cheaper and attractive for the foreign visitors. In addition it created prerequisites for the development of the domestic tourism. Thus, investment attractiveness of this segment seems fairly obvious.”  &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This mixed-use complex consists of three parts: residential for 3,000 people, Class B+ business centre with the total area of 10,000 sq. m and shopping and entertainment centre with the total area of 32,000 sq. m (20,000 sq. m GLA), including parking for 1,000 cars. There will be 100 stores in a shopping arcade, including fashion and shoes boutiques, cosmetics, goods for kids, merchandise. The entertainment part as well as cafes and restaurants will be located on the top floor.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Sunrise City has an excellent location in the very centre of the city on Suumbike avenue, next to Azatlyk avenue and city administration. The shopping centre has an excellent transport access: it is located on the major city&amp;rsquo;s highway, next to public transportation stops. Almost half of popularity of Naberezhniye Chelny lives nearby. The opening of the shopping centre is planned for Q2 2016.&#13;

Mikhail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;ldquo;Naberezhniye Chelny has one of the lowest retail space penetration rate among the cities with population of 500,000 people, that is why development of figuratively the first quality shopping mall in the city is already the part of its success. Our team is looking forward to an interesting work - to attract famous brands to this prestigious mall in the most populated district of the city.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Over the quarter, France and the UK were the best performing countries at the All Property level, rising by 3.0% and 2.4% respectively. Values in Southern Europe also picked up smartly (+1.6%), driven largely by the Industrial sector (+2.4%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Following several quarters of decline, values in CEE reversed their slide as All Property values rose by 0.8%. The Netherlands also saw values increase at the aggregate level by 0.8%; the office sector saw values decline, but there was a positive turnaround for the Industrial and Retail segments. In CEE, the buoyant Industrial sector contributed to values rising 3.0% on the previous quarter. &#13;

Matthew Edmonds, Senior Analyst, EMEA Valuation and Advisory, CORE.XP commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Once again, yield compression has been the driver of value growth across all asset classes In Europe. The prime end of the market is still the most in demand, but as investors become less risk-averse, they are looking for opportunities in secondary and tertiary markets. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“While a significant weight of money continues to target the real estate sector, we envisage modest growth to continue. As rental growth becomes more prevalent will we start to see more buoyant activity across all sectors in Europe.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Svetlana Shorina, Director of Valuation Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In contrast to European markets Russia is facing business activity decay and property price abatement. Investment into Russian commercial real estate decreased by 30% in H1 2015 on the previous year. At the same time the main focus of investors is on the less risky office segment.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The market becomes more attractive to the investors with less conservative business strategy due to the fact that commercial real estate market indices are close to the lowest points of the cycle and there is a potential of cost recovery within the next several years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Though, even for such group of investors, Russian Rouble volatility is too serious factor to make investment decisions.”&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The European Industrial and Logistics market experienced record levels of investment in Q2 2015 with the total volume reaching &amp;euro;6.1 billion. Investors are concentrating their capital on north western Europe, and particular favour lies with the UK market which accounted for 40% of the total volume. Germany, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Spain also reported strong quarterly figures.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Continuing the trend seen throughout the year, occupiers of industrial properties were predominantly third party logistics (3PLs) or retailers. In turn, these occupiers were driven by high levels of private consumption and exports from the Eurozone. Across Europe, the market is strengthening, with the Netherlands experiencing record-high H1 take up volumes, as well as a strong development pipeline. Germany, France and the UK all reported robust growth rates, on the back of a strong Q1. In contrast the automotive sector is experiencing high levels of interest in the Central and Eastern European markets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rental growth remained modest in the quarter, and was mainly concentrated in the UK and Ireland. From a yield perspective, markets that have traditionally seen higher yields such as France, Italy and Central Europe saw a contraction over the quarter. The weighted average yield for EMEA has now dropped below 7% and in many markets previous lows have been reached or overtaken. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Growing occupier demand and strong investor activity has meant that a rising development pipeline will now progress across Europe. Specifically, a number of Czech, Polish and Dutch hubs saw the creation of a strong pipeline in H1. However, in the UK and Ireland the development potential in key locations appears to be insufficient to cope with demand, particularly when taking into account the specific needs of occupiers inclusive of size, configuration and location. As the sector continues to go from strength to strength, with strong drivers for demand which remain high; we expect to see investor appetite sustain the high levels seen in this quarter.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In January &amp;ndash; August  2015 investment into the Russian commercial real estate market amounted to USD 2 bn. Around USD 250 mln., or 12%, were invested in the I&amp;amp;amp;L segment. Herewith, one should point on the very high activity of retailers, who are buying warehouse for own usage. Their purchases exceeded 400,000 sq m and USD 280 mln.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This situation is driven by the fact that prices of industrial and logistics properties are at historical and cyclical lows. And it is an excellent time to invest in logistics for any business, which has long term plans to operate in Russia. It is even truer, given that prices and rents in Roubles will not decline in the future with very high probability. The only scenario, which assumes this opportunity, is the repetition of GDP trends in 2009. It looks improbable, given Bank of Russia flexibility in exchange rate management.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The European commercial real estate (CRE) market continued its rapid growth in the second quarter of 2015, with transactions recorded for the period totaling c.&amp;euro;65 billion &amp;ndash; 32% higher than in Q2 2014.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Q2 2015 was the thirteenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in quarterly investment activity across the region, with the 12-month total now just 7% below the previous peak in the four quarters to Q3 2007.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The UK (+€9.2 billion) and Germany (+€5.0 billion) made the most significant contributions to the growth in investment activity in Q2 2015. Spain and Norway also saw substantial growth with uplifts of +€3.1 billion and +€2.3 billion respectively over the same time period.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;At a city level, the first half of 2015 saw London extend its lead as Europe&amp;rsquo;s most liquid real estate market, accounting for 20% of all European CRE investment. Paris maintained its position as Europe’s second largest market, although the gap between Paris and the rest narrowed. Germany, where the investment market is not as concentrated on a single city as in other European countries, has three cities in the top five: Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich, with Hamburg also in the top ten. Madrid has seen significant investment over the last 24 months; in H1 2013 it ranked outside the top ten and now currently sits as Europe’s sixth largest market.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Cross-border investors now account for almost half (48.5%) of the value transacted in H1 2015, some €59 billion of commercial real estate. This was up from €39 billion in H1 2014 and €27 billion in H1 2013. Nearly €20 billion of H1 2015 cross-border investment came from U.S. investors, followed by €5.9 billion from Asia. Investment from Asia was up by more than 50% compared to H1 2014; Taiwan was the largest single source of Asian investment into Europe in H1 2015, closely followed Singapore and China. Qatari buyers accounted for nearly €4 billion of acquisitions in H1 2015 and a significant proportion of the total flows from the Middle East; the majority of this came from the country’s sovereign wealth fund or its subsidiaries and nearly all was spent in the UK and Italy.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of CORE.XP Capital Markets, EMEA commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We still have a significant and growing base of capital targeting European real estate markets. London remains a magnet for core capital but we continue to witness a diversification to major continental cities as markets continue to recover. This has generated a vibrant portfolio sales market that we believe will remain strong into 2016.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime yields contracted further in the second quarter of 2015.  Industrial yields continued their substantial fall from Q1 2015 with a decrease of 15bps in Q2 2015, followed closely by high street retail and offices (both -13bps) and shopping centres (-10bps). This prime yield compression, coupled with the uptick in government bond benchmarks, resulted in the real estate yield gap falling slightly; however, it remains well above the long-term average.  Secondary yields continue to fall faster than those for prime property, although in Q2 2015 the difference between the two was relatively small.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Andrey Novikov, Managing Director of Capital Markets Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In January – August 2015 investments into Russian commercial real estate amounted to USD 2 bn. This is 24% less compared to the same period of 2014, when $2.64 bn. was invested. Cross-border investors accounted for $531 mln., which is 26,5% of the total. Their share of 25-30% of total investments is typical for the period after crisis of 2008-2009. Herewith, the main investments are coming from the players, who have significant experiences of operations in Russia and had presence here during the previous crisis, as well.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Decline of asset prices made Russian commercial real estate market very attractive for the acquisitions. Key uncertainty for potential investors is generated by high volatility of Rouble exchange rate, which adversely influences cash flows and yields in USD. End of downward trend in oil prices will significantly increase the attractiveness of the Russian commercial real estate market for investments.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Increasing demand for prime office space across a number of cities in EMEA is causing rents to accelerate, according to global real estate advisor CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Dublin&amp;rsquo;s prime office rents are now only just below their pre-crisis levels of 2009 at &amp;euro;538 per sq m per annum. This is set to increase further until supply responds to occupier demand. Similarly, the Berlin office market has reached a 12-year high of €276 per sq m pa as a strong local economy strengthens demand.  The London City office market has seen a 3.1% uplift in the last quarter and is nearly 15% higher year-on-year at &amp;pound;67 per sq ft pa. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Illustrative of the strength of demand across the region, the EMEA Prime Office Rent Index (a CORE.XP benchmark which tracks 41 cities) grew 2.1% year on year as evidenced below.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As well as strengthening economic indicators, demand for prime office space is being driven by several factors including corporate desire to:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be located in amenity rich locations to remain competitive on the local and international stage&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attract and retain the best employees&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Retain proximity to market peers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from the best quality properties&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In addition, the supply of new office space across EMEA has been subdued for some time due to low levels of development borne from the global financial crisis. Supply levels tightened further in the second quarter and this too continues to inflate rents and keep them on the upward trajectory. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Looking ahead, the office development response is set to pick-up, albeit slowly and only in certain locations. In CEE, markets such as Bucharest, Warsaw and Moscow have the strongest forecast development completions levels in EMEA. Development activity is also starting to pick up in parts of Western Europe with London, Paris, Munich and Dublin forecasting some of the highest two year projections across the region. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, EMEA Head of Occupier Research, at CORE.XP explains:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Office prime rents continue on an upward trajectory due to the current competitive landscape. Companies are vying for the best space which is in short supply in many cities. This is consistent with a broadly positive economic environment and reflected in sharply increased take-up levels. Office development activity is showing some signs of picking up which will help bridge the supply to demand gap, but not immediately.  So prime rents will remain on an upward path.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Director of Office Agency, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Asking rental rates for Prime Class A space continue to be under pressure of limited demand. In Q2 Prime rents decreased by 7-10% compared to Q1 2015 and by 21-25% compared to Q1 2014. Currently, asking rents for Prime A office space are $820-950 per sq m per year net of OpEx and VAT. Rents nominated in US dollars are still asked for the Prime Class A space while the rents for the rest part of Moscow office market are nominated in rubles or by fixing the rental rate band at the level of 50-65 rubles depending on the building. The deals closed at rents nominated in US dollars are the rare case in the current market situation. In Q2 2015 the volume of transactions done in the Prime CBD totaled 21,300 sq m of which volume of new leases was only 2,300 sq m (or 10%). Such a low level of take-up is explained by limited demand of international companies, the major “consumers” of Prime A space.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Los Angeles, September 1, 2015 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today announced that it has closed the acquisition of Johnson Controls, Inc.&amp;rsquo;s (NYSE:JCI) Global Workplace Solutions business. Global Workplace Solutions is a market-leading provider of enterprise facilities management solutions for global corporations and other large occupiers of commercial real estate. Global Workplace Solutions had revenue of more than $3.0 billion in calendar year 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a very exciting step for CORE.XP,&amp;rdquo; said Bob Sulentic, the company’s president and chief executive officer. “It advances our strategy of delivering the highest quality, globally integrated services to major occupiers and builds our relationships with many of the world’s most prominent corporations. We are helping our clients to enhance their competitive position by aligning every aspect of how they lease, own, use and operate real estate.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The advantages of outsourcing real estate services, coupled with the high quality of CORE.XP’s offering, have fueled long-term, double-digit revenue growth for its occupier outsourcing business line. The addition of Global Workplace Solutions’ expertise around the world in technical engineering, supply chain management, critical facilities and other capabilities adds significantly to CORE.XP’s already-robust service offering for occupiers.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Global Workplace Solutions is the largest provider of facilities management services outside the U.S., while CORE.XP’s facilities management services are weighted to the Americas. The combined service offering will provide clients with materially greater scale advantages in virtually every corner of the world.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Global Workplace Solutions has been merged with CORE.XP’s occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business has adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name. CORE.XP’s Global Workplace Solutions business line serves a blue-chip roster of large occupiers across a wide range of industries, particularly financial services, healthcare, industrial/manufacturing, life sciences, technology and telecommunications. CORE.XP will make available to these clients the full range of its occupier services, including property leasing and sales transactions, project management and construction services, technical engineering, consulting, and more.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP’s new Global Workplace Solutions business line is led by Bill Concannon (CEO of CORE.XP’s occupier outsourcing business line prior to the acquisition) and John Murphy (formerly president of Global Workplace Solutions when it was part of JCI).  Mr. Concannon serves as CEO, Global Workplace Solutions, and Mr. Murphy serves as COO, Global Workplace Solutions. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In EMEA, the business line will be led by Ian Entwisle as CEO supported by COO Tony Smith and Guy Holden, who joins from JCI as EMEA President of Enterprise Accounts. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mr. Concannon said: “We are thrilled that our new colleagues have joined CORE.XP. They are an enormously talented group and our combined capabilities create a value proposition that is truly unique in the marketplace.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mr. Murphy noted: “We are extremely excited to be part of the first-class team at CORE.XP. Together, we combine industry-leading intelligence across markets and asset types with superior execution to produce consistently exceptional outcomes for clients.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP now manages approximately 5 billion sq. ft. of commercial real estate and corporate facilities around the world, including 2.3 billion sq. ft. in the Americas, 1.3 billion sq. ft. in Europe, the Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa, and 1.4 billion sq. ft. in Asia Pacific. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London - Moscow, 8 September 2015 &amp;ndash; The amount invested in retail real estate in Europe in Q2 topped &amp;euro;16 billion, maintaining the more than 30% year-on-year growth rate for the sector. The biggest increases in investment activity were in Germany and Norway with a number of large transactions driving this growth.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Over the last three quarters, investment in retail property has been around the €16 billion mark, this compares to a turnover of around €12 billion per quarter for the majority of 2014. The rate of growth in retail investment activity has been over 30% per annum for more than two years, bringing the 12 month total back close to its pre-crisis peak of €63 billion in the four quarters to Q1 2007.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The German market has been particularly strong over the last few years and retail investment turnover has exceeded €2 billion in eight of the last nine quarters.  €3.1 billion of direct investment was recorded in Q2 2015. Investment in Germany was spread across a number of large transactions, including seven for more than €100 million. In addition, the Hudson Bay Company acquired department store group Kaufhof with assets totalling more than €2 billion.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Norway saw a sharp increase in activity on the back of Citycon&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of the Sketor portfolio with a gross asset value of €1.4 billion. A further €1.3 billion of retail transactions took place in H1 and as a result retail represented 45% of all Norwegian CRE investment for the first half of the year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;One of the more marked trends in the retail sector has been the greater level of investment activity from European REITs and listed property companies, both within their home markets and cross-border. They accounted for 27% of the total investment volume in H1, up from just 17% for the whole of 2014. As well as being more active buyers, European REITs are also becoming more active sellers of retail property in Europe. The last 18 months has seen them acquiring a total of €16.9 billion of retail assets and disposing of €16.4 billion. In both cases this is more than twice the level than in the previous 18 months.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;John Welham, Head of European Retail Investment, EMEA Capital Markets at CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Investment into retail has been very strong throughout the first half of the year, with investors continuing their high activity levels from 2014.  We are currently seeing a more balanced demand, for core and secondary assets, with yields for both continuing to move in. However, whilst prime and secondary yields have both come in, the gap between them remains significant - secondary has not recovered to the same extent that prime has. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“The portfolio market has been active throughout the first half of the year, particularly those with a mix of assets, providing good yield values when compared with interest rates. We expect the coming months to prove very strong with Q4 investment levels potentially rising above the previous peak of Q4 2014. Investors will also be turning their attention to markets with strong rental growth as markets such as London continue to rise in popularity.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In January – August 2015 investments into Russian retail properties amounted to $657 mln., or 33% of the total. This is 3.4 times more compared to the volumes, invested in the same period of 2014. However, these figures should not be perceived as an indicator of growth of investment attractiveness of the retail segment.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Firstly, the large share of investments was delivered by just 2 transactions: with the Gallery “Modny Sezon” and shopping and entertainment complex “Mosaic”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Secondly, consumer demand remains fairly weak: decline in retail sales in 2015 might exceed 8%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Nonetheless, significant decline in asset prices, which has occurred since the beginning of 2014, makes investments in retail properties very attractive for the investors, pursuing   relatively risky strategies. It is also worth mentioning that the majority of retail properties, delivered before 2014, benefit from quite a low vacancy rate. We expect that investment activity in this segment will grow in line with appearance of signs of stabilization in real wages and recovery of consumer demand.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Global Living Report by CORE.XP highlights how the city of Hong Kong continues to hold its position as the world’s most expensive residential location enjoying an average of &amp;pound;908 per sq ft. However, this high figure is relative to the smaller size of apartments within a market which continues to be underpinned by a severely constrained supply backdrop.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP also reports how Singapore has the second highest capital value at £570,000, although this is relative to a larger average property size of 1,100 sq ft, when compared to an average figure much closer to 800 sq ft in Hong Kong, London and New York. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As London cements its place as the world’s send highest value location according to average price per square foot, the Global Living report also brings to light how many cities are starting to witness a bounce back following the global crisis of 2008, coupled with those which have proven less resilient. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Jennet Siebrits, Head of Residential Research at CORE.XP, comments:  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;As the global population continues to expand and new innovations impact the property market, we are witnessing a move towards greater integration between our cities. What our research has found however, is that global cities are retaining what makes them unique whilst sharing valuable knowledge and experience that can enhance other cities around the world. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Using the advantage of CORE.XP’s unique position as a global property company, we have witnessed some unexpected findings in the Global Living Report, such as in Dublin, where house price growth was at a global high of 22%, and in Moscow, which has the highest proportion of owner occupiers in our sample.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In Europe, we report how the central London residential market has rebounded at a significant rate, with average house price increases of 86% since 2009. In the Outer London market we have witnessed a slower growth of 63% during the same period, demonstrating a divergence which is now narrowing, as overall prices in the UK’s Capital reach 14.8% in 2014 alone, offering investors significant growth prospects.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investors would be advised to look to areas where east meets west, with Istanbul and the South African cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town demonstrating the lowest average property prices. Perhaps a surprising investment opportunity is Sydney, which has the fifth highest capital value at £367,648. Its unit sizes are relatively large however, so on a per square foot basis the city is relatively affordable.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The Global Living Report provides a snapshot of 31 global cities, showcasing the differing influences in each city and providing a comparative study of house prices, rental growth and living costs, among other factors.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Earlier reports include the Borough by Borough Report which identified house price growth across London’s 33 boroughs and the British Living Report which explores local trends and buyer characteristics across 29 of Great Britain’s most highly populated towns and cities. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Europe  &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Barcelona &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– City living in Barcelona is reasonably affordable by Spanish standards and average house prices have experienced growth of 0.6% over the last year, bringing much needed stability to the market following the global financial crisis. 2015 is expected to be the most significant year of recovery and therefore Barcelona is considered a prime investment opportunity.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Berlin &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– With its low rents and edgy nature, Berlin has always attracted artists but the affluence of residents is now expanding. 81.2% of the population rent privately however rents are now high, even by Berlin standards, having increased by 5.7% in the last year alone. Growth is also reported in the sales market and the city is considered an exciting and affordable opportunity for investors.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Dublin &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Living costs in the vibrant capital of the Republic of Ireland are relatively expensive however they remain lower than London. Ireland is a nation of homeowners and national house prices are steadily recovering. Dublin experienced house price growth of 21.6% last year - the fastest rate of growth in the CORE.XP Global Living sample.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Edinburgh &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The historic city of Edinburgh has a large student population which underpins the rental sector; 22% of the population rents. This demand led to a 19% increase in rents last year and the housing market is just as buoyant, with house prices rising by 20% in the same period.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Frankfurt &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Frankfurt is the largest financial center in continental Europe and unemployment is low at 5.2%. Around 77.1% of the population rents privately and average rents in Frankfurt are significantly higher than the rest of Germany at £835 per month (159% higher than the national average). &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Lisbon &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The popular tourist destination of Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a long history dating back 300,000 years. Cost of living in the city is low and its property market is making a slow recovery after the global financial crisis, with the first rises in house price growth in Portugal in five years (2.2%). Foreign investors are driving the residential market, making up 22% of all sales.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;London&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – A multicultural city with 8.7 million residents, London’s population has increased by around a million people in the past decade. The central London property market rebounded quickly after the global financial crisis with residential prices increasing by 86% since 2009. The outer London market has also picked up and overall prices in London increased by 14.8% in 2014.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Madrid &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Madrid has a strong owner-occupier population with 78% of householders owner-occupied. The wider Spanish market remains muted after the global financial crisis however average property prices in Madrid rose by 0.7% last year and transactions were up 28% on the ten-year average. As the economic backdrop continues to improve, Madrid is seen as an exciting investment opportunity.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Manchester &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Often considered England’s second city, Manchester has a large rental sector with 28% of households renting privately. The rental sector is supported by a very high share of young people in the city, with four universities across Manchester and 34% of the population aged between 20 and 34. Average house prices increased by 3% last year but remain 42% lower than the national average.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Milan &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– A major financial and business centre, Milan is also one of the world’s most prominent fashion capitals. Average property prices in the city are currently 52% higher than the Italian average and Milan is popular with UK and US investors who see it as an ideal opportunity to acquire a second home.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Moscow &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The Alpha world city of Moscow has a remarkably stable property market, despite the general stagnation of the overall Russian economy. Transactions are robust with 162,000 transactions over the past year compared to 115,000 as the decade’s average. The rental market is also demonstrating a general upward trend.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Paris &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Paris has one of the highest city living costs with a beer costing £4.31 and a public transport pass coming in a £50 per month. Dominated by renters, only 33% of the Paris population is owner-occupier; rental caps came into play in August and will impact rental returns on some investment properties. There has been a surge in overseas investors and Paris is now attracting more overseas buyers than it has in the past 15 years. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rome &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– With its impressive historical ruins and cosmopolitan flair, Rome is an attractive tourist destination welcoming 30 million tourists each year. Property prices in Rome are 44% higher than the Italian average and a slight increase in transaction levels has been recorded as UK and US buyers have spotted an investment opportunity. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Americas  &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Chicago &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Following the global financial crisis, average property prices have rebounded in the wider Chicago metropolitan area and have grown 1.2% in the last year. With an average price of £120,128, Chicago sits above the national average and is expected to experience further 1.7% growth over the next year to 2016.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Los Angeles&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – With 80% of Los Angeles designated as single family residential property and strict rent control laws, there is a large supply and demand imbalance in this sprawling city, pushing up property prices. Los Angeles has one of the largest renter populations in the US (51.7%) and private rents are higher than New York having risen by 5.6% over the year to £1,600 per month.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Miami &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Miami is experiencing a strong property market, with average prices 59% higher than the national average. A period of constrained supply has boosted property prices and a recent pick up in development has resulted in a more sustainable level of price growth. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;New York&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – A lack of supply and high prices in Manhattan has led to the &amp;lsquo;Manhattanisation’ of many areas outside the island, with luxury high rise buildings being built in Brooklyn and Queens. 48% of New Yorkers rent and while average prices are lower than London, they are 42% above the national average in the US. Average house prices are nearly four times higher than the national average at £432,243.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Toronto &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– With 2,231 high rise buildings across the city, Toronto has the second highest number of tall towers in any North American city outside New York. Property prices are lower in Toronto than Vancouver, averaging £277,123 to Vancouver’s £339,416; Toronto is expected to experience house price growth of 9.6% this year.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Vancouver &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Housing prices in the Vancouver region increased by 10.3% over the last year, reflecting strong demand from migration from elsewhere in Canada and the US. The rental sector in Vancouver houses 52% of the population and rents are currently higher than in Toronto at £675 per month to Toronto’s £629. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Asia Pacific  &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Bangkok &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The colourful city of Bangkok is very affordable in terms of costs of living and currently has a very low unemployment rate of 1.1%. The luxury market is performing well, with a 30% increase in prices for off-plan condominiums. Prices for older developments are stable as the majority of Thai buyers prefer new stock to existing building projects. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Beijing &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Second only to Shanghai as China’s most populated city with 22 million residents, the population of Beijing is expected to increase by 16% in the next decade. A series of stimuli from the government to boost the residential market have had the desired effect, with sales volumes increasing by 25% over the quarter. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Hong Kong&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – This vertical city has the highest average property price across the sample, at £508,000 (£908 psf). Despite the introduction of a special Stamp Duty and tightening of mortgage lending policies, prices have continued to increase, rising 13.5% in 2014 and 7.2% in the first five months of this year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Shanghai &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Home to 24.3 million people (and due to increase by 13.3% over the next decade) Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the world. Government interventions following the booming market in 2013 led to a slowdown in house price growth. In March 2015, the People’s Bank of China lowered the minimum down payment for first-time buyers and upgraders, stimulating demand and causing a pick-up in sales values.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Singapore &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– A strong economy and the attractiveness of Singapore as a place to live has created a strong housing market, which until last year was increasing by an average of 8% per year over the past decade. Government interventions have affected current prices and Singapore is now expected to have a lower growth market than before. Prices remain high, with average property prices at £570,000 - the top end of the CORE.XP sample.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Sydney &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The concentration of banks in Sydney has led to the city becoming recognised as one of Asia Pacific’s leading financial hubs. High demand and long-term undersupply have driven up housing prices however this undersupply is now being addressed, with 39,114 home approvals in 2013-14. Average house prices in Sydney increased by 12.9% last year and are 38% higher than the national average.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tokyo &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Tokyo is home to the largest metropolitan economy in the world and its urban area had a total GDP of £1.2trn in 2012. The housing market was affected by the global financial crisis but rebounded in 2010. Under half of Tokyo’s population is owner-occupiers and whilst average prices are £264,401, the relatively modest size of the properties translates to a fairly high £447 psf. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Africa  &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Cape Town&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – One of the most beautiful cities in South Africa, Cape Town welcomes 1.5 million foreign tourists each year. Despite a high unemployment rate of 23.9%, the city’s economy is picking up with GDP growth of 2.9% over the past year. Wealth polarization is mirrored in the property market, rendering ‘average’ figures somewhat unreliable. The rental market is strong and 28% of residents rent privately. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Johannesburg &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The economic and financial hub of South Africa, Johannesburg produces 16% of the nation’s GDP. A large transient workforce preferring to rent privately has resulted in 37% of the population living in private rental property. Average rental figures mask wide discrepancy in property type and wealth. The residential sales market is strong, experiencing 7% house price growth over the last year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Middle East, North Africa and Turkey  &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Abu Dhabi &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– Abu Dhabi’s population of 2,570,000 is expected to increase by 54% over the next decade, adding an additional 1.38 million residents. The property market experienced 31% growth in 2013 and 24% growth in 2014, and has since taken on a more stable pace as a result of lower oil prices. The rental market is robust, with 12% growth over the last year taking values to £1,698 per month. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Dubai &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The promise of an opulent lifestyle and tax-free salaries has created a large expat community in Dubai, with 92% of the population made up of expats and migrant workers. A buoyant market saw 22,989 transactions last year, 28% higher than the 10 year average. A trend of large quantities of new developments is expected to continue, with 25,000 new units built on average each year.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Istanbul &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;– The fifth largest city in the world, Istanbul is seen as a strong investment opportunity. Last year the city enjoyed 15% annual house price growth and the rental market experienced similar growth of 12% in rents. Istanbul has the lowest average property price in the sample at £72 psf. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The lease agreement is signed for 7 years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Logistic complex VS Logistic is located on Gorkoskoye highway in 44 km from MKAD. The total area of the logistic complex will be around 120,000 sq. m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The company with 138 stores in different regions of Russian was looking for the warehouse to open distribution center and to arrange logistics to their stores from this central warehouse.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Previously MODIS used to work with third party logistics services. This time MODIS decided to become a direct lease contract-owner to do all the operations by themselves. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The deal was closed in a very short period of time (2 weeks). &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova joins as Head of Capital Markets, Russia. Previously Head of Capital Markets, Russia &amp;amp;amp; CIS at Cushman &amp;amp;amp; Wakefield, Irina built the team into one of the country&amp;rsquo;s leading investment advisers. Recently she has advised on USD 800 million worth of transactions including the sale of Pokrovsky Hills, an elite residential development managed by Hines, and BIN Group’s acquisition of PNK Chekhov 1 Logistics Park. Prior to this, Irina spent eight years at JLL, in senior roles within its capital markets and hotels advisory teams in Moscow.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elena Podlesnykh joins as Director, Capital Markets, Russia. Prior to Cushman &amp;amp;amp; Wakefield, Elena worked in leading positions in large Russian and international corporations, such as JLL Capital Markets for 5 years, VEB and Rosbank. Elena has more than 12 years of experience in private equity and M&amp;amp;amp;A, as well as in construction projects general management and capital markets. Elena also has an INSEAD EMBA. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina and Elena will join CORE.XP on 21 September 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
These appointments follow a number of strategic investments into CORE.XP’s Russian business in the last 18 months, which have resulted in substantial growth despite a challenging market. This has been particularly noticeable in the substantial market share gains achieved by its office leasing, corporate advisory and industrial/warehousing leasing teams following the hiring of leading professionals in those sectors. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vladimir Pinaev, CEO, Russia, CORE.XP commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;I am extremely delighted to welcome two such highly regarded industry professionals to CORE.XP. These appointments underline our ambition to be the advisor of choice in all markets of importance to our clients and will allow us to further develop our Capital Markets team, which we see as a key strategic growth area for our business&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“While investment volumes have fallen year on year in Russia, we continue to see good demand from domestic as well as international investors for high quality assets driven by the reduction in values and attractive potential returns for prime opportunities across a range of sectors.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Head of Capital Markets, Russia, CORE.XP added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“We are excited to join forces with CORE.XP Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Pinaev. CORE.XP’s platform is exceptionally attractive both for us and clients, providing wide access to global capital, experts and insights. We look forward to building a full service client centric Capital Markets team together.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Martin Samworth, CEO – EMEA, CORE.XP added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Our ability to attract professionals of the standing of Irina and Elena are testament to the strength of our Russian business and its growing reputation. In the past 18 months we have seen a transformation of our business there and in the face of a challenging market we are pleased to see continued growth and an exceptionally positive response from clients to the investments we have been making.” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Torgoviy Park N1 in Zhukovskiy is planned to be opened in March 2016. The other tenants are commissioning their premises and starting fit-out works.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The developer of the retail park Norman Asset Management has signed long-term lease agreements with such well-known companies as OBI, Decathlon, H&amp;amp;amp;M, Gloria Jeans, L&amp;rsquo;Etoile and many others. Over 75% of the premises have been leased, that means that Torgoviy Park N1 is in high demand among the tenants.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Torgoviy Park N1 in Zhukovskiy, Russia (with 54,000 sq m GBA) is located in 20 km from the MKAD on the crossing of Novoryazanskoye highway and Rechnoy proezd, close to the two towns in the Moscow region, Zhukovskiy and Ramenskoye. Over 300,000 people live around the shopping centre.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nadezhda Tsvetkova, Associate Director, Retail Department, CORE.XP Russia, commented: &amp;ldquo;It is almost 5 months before the grand opening of Torgoviy Park N1 and there are very few retail premises left. This means that despite high vacancy rate in shopping malls around Russia as well as in Moscow region, this shopping mall is in much demand. Taking into the account that the town of Zhukovskiy is located just in 20 km from Moscow and that the majority of its population are the young people with high income, the same as in Moscow we are confident that international and federal brands, that are focused on this target group will soon lease the premises of the shopping arcade. “&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The company&amp;rsquo;s history has started in 1957. This group today unites Detskiy mir retail chain of 322 stores in 131 cities in Russia and Kazakhstan as well as Early Learning Centres, 44 in total.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
All Detskiy mir stores occupy 436,000 sq. m and the Early Learning centres occupy 6,000 sq. m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Yaroslavskiy Vernisazh was put into operation in 2007. The total area of the shopping mall is 43,200 sq. m. There is no vacant space left in the shopping mall at the moment. MirLand Development Corporation is the developer of this shopping centre.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nadezhda Tsvetkova, Associate Director of Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Reinforcement of tenant &amp;ndash;mix the aim of which is to increase customers’ flow is the common practice among the existing shopping centres today. Yaroslavskiy Vernisazh is located in the very populated district of the city of Yaroslavl. The target audience of this shopping centre are the families with children. So it is quite logical to open the largest in Yaroslavl Detskiy mir store in Yaroslavskiy Vernisazh shopping and entertainment complex.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
While in 2014, offices experienced the most investment, (44% of total) this year retail takes the lead, at 41% of total investment volume. More than two thirds of the retail transactions were Grade A, located primarily either in a capital city or in a big regional city. Investors are attracted to this type of product, as the performance of the assets is verified, both in terms of footfall and tenants sales, thus income stability is almost guaranteed. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The star within the CEE region is Czech Republic with a stellar increase of 130% y-o-y, as a number of high-profile, one of a kind properties were transacted in this past year, for example Palladium scheme and the RPG Byty residential portfolio. These two transactions alone account for almost a quarter of total CRE investment volume in 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Poland retains its attractiveness, with a diverse profile of transactions being closed and a strong pipeline of deals expecting to close in Q4, but the overall volume is down compared to last year (-15%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
On the back of unstable political environment, Russia registered a decrease in CRE investment volume by 13% y-o-y. Still, top-tier office products are perceived as a safe-haven, thus this sector registered marginal differences to previous years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Smaller markets, like Romania and Slovakia are experiencing a slowdown in investment deals, with double digit decreases compared to 2014. For both countries, pipeline transactions could change the outcome by year&amp;rsquo;s end.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Throughout all core-CEE countries pricing continues to increase for prime products, as investors interest for this type of assets is on the rise. These are generally occupied by class A tenants, offering long-term stability and return on investment. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;In Q3 2015 investments in Russian property amounted to €843 mln. which is 13% less compared to the same period of 2014. However, these figures should not be perceived as the proof of investors’ pessimism. It is worth mentioning that investment volumes are growing for the third quarter in a row. And there is a number of rather large transactions in pipeline, which, if closed, will generate significant positive contribution in the yearly investment statistics. Apart from the mentioned properties, such as BP Aurora Park, one of the towers of BC Metropolis, SEC Atrium, logistics complexes of PNK Group – the newest object of investors’ interest is SEC Columbus. Thus, current statistics does not reflect the real investors’ activity in the market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Growth of investors’ interest is very logical, given current market situation. In offices, retail and I&amp;amp;amp;L segment vacancy either has already reached its cyclical high, or will reach the top in Q4 2015. After that, in 2016 vacancy will follow downward trend. This is explained by sharp reduction of a new supply in 2016-2018. It allows speculating about close proximity of so expected “market trough&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Of course, there is still a possible instability of rents in USD terms as a result of Rouble volatility. However, there is a growing consensus among market participants that in Rouble equivalent of rents will not decline anymore.”&#13;

Shoppers in the UAE, South Africa, Turkey, Romania and Spain particularly identified with shopping centres as a key food and beverage destinations. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The report surveyed 22,000 customers across 22 markets in Europe, South Africa and the Middle East to understand what their perceptions were of F&amp;amp;amp;B within the shopping centre environment. The results showed that 59% of shoppers in the UAE, 57% in South Africa, 52% in Turkey, 51 % in Poland and 42% in Spain visit a shopping centre just to eat or drink. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Moreover, even if their main reason for visiting a centre was to eat and drink, an average of 40% of people then go on to shop. &#13;

 Peter Gold, Head of EMEA Cross Border Retail, CORE.XP said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;We know that a shopping centre is more than the sum of its parts: it&amp;rsquo;s about the overall proposition. With shopping centres competing for shopper attention, F&amp;amp;amp;B will become increasingly important as a footfall and revenue driver. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “A strong food and beverage offer fits with the notion that shopping is a leisure activity. Customers not only have a &amp;lsquo;desire’ to shop, but have a ‘need’ to eat. With that in mind, our research shows that more than 40% of people will visit shops even if their primary reason to visit was to eat or drink. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Andrew Phipps, Head of Retail Research and Consulting, CORE.XP EMEA said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “The differences in perception across Europe and the Middle East are mainly cultural. In the Middle East and Turkey, a visit to a mall is seen as an important leisure activity as well as a time-efficient way to shop. Traditionally, their F&amp;amp;amp;B offer has been more inviting, however climate also has an impact, whether it is inclement weather typical in northern European countries or the extreme heat experienced in the Middle East. In all cases the result is consumers preferring to shop and/or eat in the same place, since this means less exposure to the elements.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “These local cultural differences have a huge impact in the way a shopping centre should be designed and should cater for its customers. With 42% of people across EMEA visiting a shopping centre once a week or more and 36% rating food and a beverage as very or extremely important, an innovative, well curated food and beverage line-up provides a much richer experience to shopping centre visitors, encouraging them to make regular return visits.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Michail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, СBRE in Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “F&amp;amp;amp;B value proposition is rather important for the Russian consumers, though, of course, they visit shopping malls not only for it. Current economic situation forces consumers to reduce their expenses, declining interest to visit shopping malls. As a result, developers of shopping malls should elaborate new competitive advantages to sustain and increase footfall. An average consumer is ready to save money on clothes, but not on food. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Today turnovers of F&amp;amp;amp;B operators in Russia have decreased. First of all it affected weak retailers who can`t make a good offer to consumers while strong brands become even stronger and continued development. Their involvement in the creation of professional food court with a varied menu and affordable prices can serve as a powerful advantage for developer as well as ensure the operator’s traffic, thereby increasing the percentage of revenue. For example, in the nearest future IKEA plans to open renovated food courts with an increased number of tenants and a wider variety of choice in their existing projects. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In addition, cooperation among food operators and other tenants, based on joint actions and discount programs, could be even more effective in terms of growth of footfall.” &#13;

However, 2015 is continuing the trend seen in 2014 where Class A delivery accounts for the majority of the total. It is estimated that delivery of Class A space will reach 0.42 mln sq m, and Class B 0.38 mln sq m this year (compared to 0.71 mln sq m and 0.69 mln sq m respectively in 2014). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Moscow office market tendencies in Q3 2015:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up amounted to 211,400 sq m (47% higher than in Q1 and 13% higher than in Q2 2015). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up may exceed 250,000 sq m in Q4 2015. However, the stabilisation of the Rouble and an absence of further negative events are key factors. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Renewals and renegotiations remained considerable, at 170,500 sq m (22% increase compared to Q2 2015).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Delivery of 300,000 sq m of office space has been postponed to 2016: as a result new supply for 2015 has decreased from 1.1 mln to 0.8 mln sq m. 240,600 sq m of new office space was commissioned in Q3 2015.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The vacancy rate increased from 16.9% to 17.6% due to a large amount of new delivery. The vacancy rate may stop increasing in Q4 2015.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Rental rates remained relatively stable. Rental decreases affected only 6% of vacant Class A space.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;SUPPLY&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q3 newly delivered office space amounted to 240,600 sq m, 129,100 sq m (54%) of which is Class A, and 111,500 sq m Class B. Due to the commissioning of the Oruzheiny 41 business centre (100,000 sq m), the CBD accounted for the largest share of new supply, 110,300 sq m (46% of the overall total). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Simonov Plaza (49,150 sq m) was put into operation in the area between the GR and the TTR, and 6 office buildings totalling 81,150 sq m in the area between the TTR and the MKAD, with the largest in this part: Kuntsevo Plaza (29,000 sq m), Algoritm (25,000 sq m), and Danilov Plaza (12,600 sq m). &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 No office buildings were delivered in Moscow-City, or in the area beyond the MKAD. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;TAKE-UP &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 An increase in take-up has been recorded now for two consecutive quarters. Take-up (new lease and sale deals) concluded in the market during Q3 2015 totalled 211,400 sq m, of which 73,800 sq m (35%) was Class A and 137,600 sq m (65%) Class B. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Total transactions for the first three quarters of 2015 amounted to 541,900 sq m or 60-70% of that expected by the end of 2015 (estimated at 750,000–850,000 sq m). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 A significant part of all transactions is represented by lease renewals and renegotiations; these totalled 170,500 sq m in Q3 2015 and 396,700 sq m for the first three quarters. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Companies prefer to fix better commercial terms for the short term in their existing business centres. This is largely due to the fact that the end of the crisis is not obvious and it is difficult for companies to plan their future business development. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 However, a number of large companies are using the current market conditions to relocate, for example, adidas Group leased 20,000 sq m at Krylatsky Hills Business Park Building 5.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;VACANCY RATES&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 The total vacancy rate increased from 16.9% in Q2 to 17.6% in Q3; in the Class A segment the increase was from 25.8% to 26.8% and in Class B from 13.9% to 14.5%. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The increase is partially caused by the amount of new delivery and also by previously occupied space starting to enter the market as companies relocated to new offices. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;RENTAL RATES&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 For the second consecutive quarter asking rental rates appear relatively stable. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 It is worth noting that achievable rents are often 10-20% lower than asking rates. The currency corridor for rents averages between 55 and 65 RUB per USD. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Class A Prime asking rental rates are $820–950 per sq m per annum net of operating expenses and VAT. Rental rates for Class A offices in the city centre are $600–750; for Class A in the area outside the TTR $450-550; rents are $250–400 in the Class B segment or 17,000 RUB, while the most common range is 13,000–23,000 RUB. Rental rates are denominated in dollars for only 6% of Class B offices. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Elena Denisova, Director of Office Agency, CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;In Q3 the market was active despite the following factors: this period is traditionally characterised by low business activity due to the summer holidays, and Q3 2015 saw the rouble devaluation. Take-up grows for two consecutive quarters. The largest share in Class A new lease transactions is done by several international companies (office space more than 8,000 sq m). These are only three deals, two ones were done in Q2, one – in Q3 2015. In terms of volume, these transactions amounted to around 60% of the total volume of new Class A transactions done by international companies. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 We expect large international companies to remain active players in the Class A market in terms of relocation. This is not surprising. Current market situation allows doing the best deals and fixing the most attractive commercial terms in the long term&amp;rdquo;. &#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, October 26, 2015 &amp;mdash; Global commercial real estate (CRE) investment reached US$407 billion in H1 2015, the strongest first half to a year since 2007, and up 14 per cent year-over-year, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP Group, Inc.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Though rapid growth has been maintained for several years, the rate of growth slowed in H1 2015 and was vastly different at a regional and country level. The Americas experienced growth of 31 per cent year-over-year, while a strong dollar impacted activity in EMEA (Europe, Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa) and Asia Pacific (APAC). In dollar terms, EMEA was up just 5 per cent from H1 2014, with APAC down 19 per cent year-over-year. When measured in local currency EMEA grew by 25%, while a decline in APAC was more muted at 9% year-on-year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The U.S., U.K. and Germany remain, by far, the largest CRE investment markets globally. A combined total of US$301 billion was transacted in these three countries in H1 2015—representing an unusually high (74 per cent) share of the global market and 10 per cent above the long-term average of 64 per cent. &#13;

&amp;ldquo;Capital flows into real estate are well supported. Even ignoring rental value growth, real estate offers a &amp;lsquo;spread&amp;rsquo; over bond rates of between 200 to 300 bps across global markets and capital will continue to be attracted to the sector,&amp;rdquo; said Iryna Pylypchuk, Director, Global Research, CORE.XP. “The influx of new sources of capital targeting real estate as part of long-term liability-matching allocation strategies is helping to extend the investment cycle. At the same time, this pushes the ‘old capital’ into niche sectors, prompting expansion of the investment universe.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The recent economic slowdown in Asia has led to China, Singapore and South Korea dropping down in the top 20 market rankings during H1 2015. Canada was the only non-Asian market to experience a notable fall in the rankings, with its western regions relying heavily on oil for economic activity, weaker occupier fundamentals slowed investment activity. Rapid uplifts in investment in Europe’s recovery markets Italy, Ireland and Spain meant significantly improved positions in the rankings.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Cross-border investors have grown in influence to become an important driver of CRE investment globally, particularly in the last 24 months, and are changing the shape of the market. The world’s leading destinations, in terms of global capital flows, is a balanced mix of cities across all main regions—London was the most targeted city by cross-border investors in H1 2015, followed by New York and Paris. This contrasts with the top destinations for overall investment where the bias is strongly on the U.S.—New York was the leading city overall, followed by London and Los Angeles. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/dcb/top 20 cities by cre investment q3 2015.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;top 20 cities by cre investment q3 2015.jpg&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;top 20 cities by cre investment q3 2015.jpg&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;740&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;366&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a regional level, the influence of global investors varies from as little as 10 per cent in the Americas, to almost 50 per cent of the market in EMEA. The largest contributor to these flows during H1 2015 was the U.S., accounting for a stand-out US$25.4 billion of investment outside its home market. The next three largest sources were Canada ($US8.5 billion), Germany (US$7.1 billion) and China (US$6.6 billion), with their combined volume still considerably less than the U.S.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The influence of global capital is growing to the point that these investors are becoming the “market-maker” in setting the price in the most desired and liquid markets across the globe. Within this growing wave of cross-border capital, there are elements of old and new,” said Chris Ludeman, Global President, Capital Markets, CORE.XP.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“A recurrent wave of U.S. equity funds continues to explore global opportunities in search of higher returns off the back of strong buying power of the U.S. dollar. German capital is searching for steady investments outside their home market—a notable shift in strategy post-GFC. Despite low oil prices, Middle Eastern buyers remain active, with the investor base growing and strategies targeted at greater geographic and sector diversification.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“There are numerous new sources of capital that have emerged only recently. With its commodity driven economy slowing, Canadian investors have sought opportunities abroad. The lower oil price has triggered and accelerated global deployment of capital from the Middle East’s non-institutional investors, particularly private high net worth. However, of all the new sources, Asia has been the most captivating due to the size, speed and potential long-term impact brought by the recent regulatory changes; this has allowed many of the local pensions funds and insurance companies to invest globally for the first time,” Mr. Ludeman added.&#13;

Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, CORE.XP in Russia:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In H1 2015 investments in Russian commercial real estate were just USD 1.09 bn. This is 32% less compared to the same period of 2014. Switzerland, who took over the last place in the top 20 the most attractive destinations for the investments in CRE in the world, had received USD 0,7 bn. more than Russia. Noticeable decline in investment activity in Russia was the logical outcome of economic crisis and geopolitical tensions.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nonetheless, in H2 2015 some growth of investor interest to Russian CRE market was registered. Since the beginning of H2 cumulative investments amounted to USD 1.11 bn. Thus, total YTD investment volumes reached USD 2.2 bn. This amount is 22% less than in January &amp;ndash; October 2014. In addition, according to estimates, there is USD 2.4 bn. of transactions is currently on the different stages of negotiation.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Increase of investor interest to discuss available opportunities is quite logical. From the one point of view, it is explained by already started process of market self-regulation: freezing postponements in delivery of the existing projects and small new plans for the next years. From another point of view, real GDP decline in Q4 2015 might be smaller compared to Q2 and Q3. If first signs of stabilization of economic activity are confirmed by good Q4 statistics, then in 2016 investments in commercial real estate will show growth compared to 2015”.&#13;

This interest is fuelled by increasing leasing activity and growing market confidence that the Rouble equivalent of rents will not decline further. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Key indicators in Q3 2015:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investment volumes grow for the third quarter in a row. In the next quarter 4Q moving average will stop declining and start to turn upwards &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Seasonality only partly explains this situation, as there is a fairly large volume of potential investments in the pipeline &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Leasing activity is showing signs of recovery. New supply is reducing faster than expected, and this process has started already in H2 2015 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The chances are increasing that in terms of prices the market is now passing at cyclical low levels &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A growth of oil prices to USD 60/barrel will support stabilization and CRE market recovery &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q3 2015 investment in Russian commercial real estate amounted to USD 925 mln. This is 24.5% less than in the same period of 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In the first 9 months of 2015 the share of cross-border investments reached 27%, which is equivalent to USD 543 mln. Almost all transactions were focused on the office segment. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investment in regions amounted to just USD 29 mln. in the first 3 quarter of 2015. This is less than 1,5% of the overall total investment during that period. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q3 in the office market there is a growth of leasing activity against the background of rents, being stable two quarters in a row. Key transactions are the sales of Metropolis business centre, bld. 3, and Zarechiye business centre. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q3 the share of investment transactions in retail increased. Key contributor to this was the sale of Gallery Modny Sezon. Retail segment remains under pressure of weak demand, nonetheless, vacancy in new properties with strong location and concept is steadily declining. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In Q3 in the warehousing market tenants have finally appreciated the attractiveness of current very low prices for warehousing premises. We observe high volumes of end-user acquisitions. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Continuation of the upward trend in leasing activity in Q4 2015 could develop sound foundations for a decline in capitalization rates. Current capitalization rates for prime properties in Moscow remained stable: Office – 9.5–10%, Retail – 9.75–10.25%, I&amp;amp;amp;L – 12.5 – 13%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 As of October 2015, transactions in negotiation stage amounted to 2.4 bn., which is 20% above the total investment activity in Jan – Sep 2015. In addition, increasing purchasing activity by tenants should be highlighted: acquisitions of 50,000 – 100,000 sq m warehousing premises by DIY and food retailers, the Megafon deal to buy a stake in Oruzheyniy business center for more than USD 280 mln. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Valentin Gavrilov, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;There is still high uncertainty on the market, and one more wave of decline in rents and increase in vacancy cannot be excluded. Nonetheless, it is necessary to mention that fundamental mechanisms of the market self-regulation had already started working: i.e. significant decline in new construction activity. If Rouble exchange rate remains fairly stable in Q4 2015, then we might see continuation of tenant demand growth in the future. Risks are still high, but potential profit is becoming more and more interesting for the long term investors. This fact is reflected in a quite large pipeline of deals in the negotiation stage&amp;rdquo;. &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The decrease in real disposable income is forcing consumers to switch to cheaper products. According to &amp;ldquo;Sberbank-CIB&amp;rdquo;, 69% of consumers followed this course of action in Q3 2015 compared to 63% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, 65% of consumers began to cut spending even on everyday goods, and to choose more affordable grocery stores. The reduction in the purchasing power of personal incomes is continuing to affect retail sales, which in real terms fell by 8.5% in the first nine months of 2015. At the same time, large FMCG retailers are more resilient in the current situation, and are showing a 10-30% growth in turnover due to the opening of new stores. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;SUPPLY AND DELIVERY FORECAST&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The total modern retail stock in Moscow reached 5,139,000 sq m in Q3, or 419 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The second stage of Vnukovo Outlet Village was opened in Q3 2015. Its rentable area totals 10,200 sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
We expect that delivery in Q4 will reach 143,200 sq m GLA in five new shopping centres. Three of these (Avenue South West, RIO on Kievskoye highway and Kalita) are already at the final stages of fit-out, and will very probably be opened on time. Galereya Kutuzovsky and the retail gallery in MFC Evolution Tower that were scheduled to open by the end of 2015, will now be put in operation in 2016.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;DEMAND&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
According to our estimates, net absorption of retail space in Q3 fell to 4,100 sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
11 new brands entered the Moscow market in Q3. Moreover, during last three months, 4 new brands have announced their plans to open their first stores in Moscow. As a result we expect to see 7-8 new brands in the Moscow market by the end of 2015.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
2 brands (American Eagle Outfitters and Desigual) left the market as a result of chain optimisation and new development strategies. In total 6 brands left the market during the first nine months of 2015.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;VACANCY AND COMMERCIAL TERMS&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
In Q3 the vacancy rate in Moscow shopping centres remained at practically the same level as in the previous quarter (9.2%). However, by the end of the year the vacancy rate may reach 11% following the &amp;lsquo;technical openings’ of new shopping centres.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the shopping centres that were opened during 2014-2015, the amount of vacant space is steadily decreasing. This is largely due to the flexibility of owners on commercial terms. This prompted 11 out of the 29 new brands that came to Moscow this year to open their first stores in new shopping centres. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The decline in consumer activity is mainly being reflected in the visitor numbers in regional and super regional shopping centres, which are having difficulty retaining traffic as consumers spend less on entertainment and large purchases. Footfall in these centres reduced by 10-15% on average compared to the previous year. However, projects with a favourable location and consistently high traffic are hardly suffering from loss of customers.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Around 75-80% of market players switched to rental rates in Rouble equivalent, which in 70% of cases is calculated as a percentage of turnover. At the same time, rental rates in USD continue to decline: prime rents decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2015, and amounted to $1,650/sq m/year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;STREET RETAIL&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The vacancy rate in Moscow high streets in October 2015 reached 8.5%, or 39,530 sq m. The increase in average vacancy is mainly caused by an increase in the vacancy level on some streets. For example, vacancy on Leninsky Avenue increased by 20%, it doubled on Petrovka Street, and rose by 2.5 times on Myasnitskaya Street. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Among the most significant openings in the third quarter were the openings of the Pandora boutique on Tverskaya Street, the Falconeri store on Kuznetsky Most Street, Celine in Tretyakovsky Proezd, and the first Modbrand boutique in Stoleshnikov Lane. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A significant event in the street retail market in September was the refurbishment of more than 15 streets within the Garden Ring. New retail destinations can be used by retailers for development of their chains and produce more favourable conditions for existing outlets.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Michael Rogozhin, Managing Director, Retail department, CORE.XP, Russia:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Such fundamental factors as significant decline in GDP and real income of consumers continue to have negative impact on the retail trade and, as a consequence, the volume of absorption of retail space. The slowdown of new retail space supply in the Q3 was a temporary deterrent to growth of vacancy rate, peaking at the end of 2015. In 2016, the market is expected to start a gradual recovery of supply and demand balance, supported by decline in new construction and growth of business and consumer activity.&#13;

Across the total of 162 sector/city combinations throughout the EMEA region, 71 saw prime yields moving lower and none saw any increase over the quarter.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime yields fell across all main sectors, and are now generally 40-50 basis points lower than they were a year ago. The most marked shift was recorded in the industrial &amp;amp;amp; logistics sector where prime yields fell by 20 basis points in the quarter, and nearly 60 basis points on the year, reflecting very strong investment appetite for the sector with nearly &amp;euro;12bn of assets traded in the past two quarters. Many of the major strategic European logistics hubs saw yields moving lower over the quarter, including Paris, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Milan and Brussels.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The office sector saw slightly less pronounced changes (prime yields down by 18 basis points on the quarter; 47 basis points year on year) but did attain a notable milestone with yields dipping below their previous low of 2007, to stand at just under 5%. Retail yields also edged lower, though only marginally so in the high street sector.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
By contrast, the retail sector led the way in terms of rents, with prime high street rents up 6.7% compared with a year ago. Prime London West End retail rents rose by over 7% QonQ. Further notable rental increases were recorded in the German and Spanish office markets, and UK regional cities across all sectors. Across the survey as a whole, rental increases were rather sparse, with 30 of the 162 sector/city combinations recording higher rents and ten declining, several of them in the CEE region where there is more availability which is inhibiting rental growth. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Commenting, Richard Holberton, Senior Director, EMEA Research at CORE.XP, added:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Falls in prime yields have been a feature of the market for three years now, and this quarter&amp;rsquo;s data gives every indication of the trend continuing, or even accelerating. This is linked with strong investment demand for real estate and a supportive capital markets environment characterized by low bond yields, low real interest rates and continued quantitative easing. On the rental side, while the pattern is certainly not clear-cut, there are indications that some of the early-cycle growth markets such as London and Dublin are heading into a period of slower growth, while some of the later-recovery markets notably Spain are beginning to pick up speed.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;YIELDS&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Office yields&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; across EMEA fell in Q3 2015. The CORE.XP EMEA Prime Office Yield Index fell by 18 bps in the quarter, and is now 47 bps lower than a year ago. 29 of the 58 markets surveyed saw downward yield movements this quarter, and 29 remained unchanged. A number of markets saw falls of 50 bps or more including Milan, Lisbon and Belgrade.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;RENTS&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Prime office rents &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;across Europe remained flat in Q3 2015, up by 0.6% in the quarter and 2.1% year-on-year. Office rents rose in 15 locations, fell in three and remained static in the remaining 40. Among the major markets the most significant increases were in Dublin and Stockholm (both up over 5%). The largest fall was in St Petersburg, down 16%, with Warsaw also declining.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Prime retail rents&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; were flat in Q3 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime High Street Retail index up 0.5% and the Shopping Centre Rent index unchanged. Retail rents rose in eight locations, fell in three and remained static in the remaining 43. The largest rise was recorded in London’s West End (up 7.7%). Amsterdam, Stockholm and Lisbon also recorded increases. The most significant declines were in Russia, with rents in both Moscow and St Petersburg falling.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Prime industrial rents&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; remained stable in Q3 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Industrial Rent Index up by 0.5% in the quarter, and 1.4% in year-on-year terms. Seven of the 50 sample locations rose, four fell and the remaining 39 stayed unchanged. The risers included Dublin, Brussels, Glasgow and Lyon. The major fallers were again Moscow and St Petersburg.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“European commercial real estate market continues to heat up under the influence of very low interest rates on fixed income instruments, large availability of funding and gradual recovery of economic activity in Europe.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As a result, achievable yield for investors, say, in office segment, is already lower than it was at the market cycle peak in 2007.However, further reduction in yields cannot be excluded under the influence of zero or negative interest rates on funding from ECB and other central banks. This trends has already lasted for 3 years and have all chances to continue in the future, unless the current approach to the monetary policy is changed fundamentally. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Russia asked by investors yields on investments in prime properties are: in offices – 9,5–10%, in retail – 9,75%-10,25%, I&amp;amp;amp;L – 12,5%-13%. These indicators are relatively stable during 2015. Herewith, one should mention gradual recovery of investor interest to acquisitions. Asset prices had already become rather attractive for the long term players, and only improvement in GDP trend is required for growth of transaction activity. This might take place in the middle of H1 2016”.&#13;

  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;ldquo;While there are still some investment risks associated with the cohesion of the Eurozone, and the impact of slower growth in China and other emerging markets, capital appetite for real estate remains high. So while corporate property sales across Europe are rising, their share of the overall market has been shrinking. In 2008, during the early throes of the financial crisis corporate disposals accounted for 1 in 5 sales, or 18%, of the total market. This figure was halved last year to just 9%. Behind the raw figures, one interesting shift we are seeing is a greater willingness by corporates to seek short leases in sale-and-leaseback transactions, because of the critical need for flexibility, even though this will dilute the sale price they can command&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Eurozone Breakdown &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
   The last 18 months has seen the UK lead the way with corporate disposals accounting for 29% of the total market, closely tailed by Germany with 22% market share. The UK and Germany remain the dominant force with more than half of the combined market at 51%. This is consistent with the average across the last decade although the UK is slightly ahead of, and Germany slightly behind, its median position. A number of major retail transactions combined with significant Central London and office mixed use disposals underpin the UK total. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

   The Netherlands (9%), France (7%) and Spain (7%) account for just under a further quarter of the 2014-15 market, and the Nordic region for an additional 15%. Other than Spain where recent market share is around its ten year average, southern Europe has been comparatively weak, with Italy accounting for 3% of the market compared with a more typical figure of 7%. &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Retail and Industrial Sectors Gain Momentum&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
   Improving economic conditions, falling unemployment and higher consumption growth across Europe is providing a favorable backdrop for the acquisition of retail and industrial assets. In the first half of 2015, collective retail corporate disposals hit €2.2bn almost the same figure for the whole of 2014 at €2.4bn. The industrial sector also picked up, with its 2014-15 market share reaching 14% compared with a long-run average of 9%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   The office sector remains the largest single component of corporate disposals with 38% of all activity in the first half of 2015. In addition, mixed-use buildings now represent 5% of the total market with a turnover of €442 in H1 2015 compared to €100m across the full calendar year in 2014. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

   John Wilson, Executive Director – EMEA Global Workplace Solutions, at CORE.XP explains:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   “Corporate real estate disposals are used as a traditional method to raise capital. At present, low borrowing costs mean the corporate bond market is attractive and on average UK corporate profits have grown by over 4% per year over the last three, meaning retained earnings can fund onward investment. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   “So, new disposal trends are emerging indicative of funding change. These are, companies managing down surplus property assets post acquisition, disposal of older buildings, and advancement of corporate sustainability aims which is often linked to the removal of older assets increasingly executed through structures that allow sharing of proceeds between investor and corporate. In essence, the fact that many transactions are motivated by the desire to fund long-term strategic plans also reflects growing confidence in external market conditions”.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   Valentin Gavrilov, Director of Research, CORE.XP in Russia:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   “Corporate business quite often shows very good property management skills, buying at cyclical lows and selling close to price peaks. In this regard, the situation when the last peak of corporate property disposals was observed in 2007 – right before the world crisis – can hardly be considered as a fortuity. Thus, growing volumes of corporate property disposals in Europe in the last year might be perceived as empirical evidence that business believes that current prices are high. As a result, the volumes of sales are increasing despite the opportunity to attract very cheap financing from the lending market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   Russian situation is an opposite example. After decline of asset prices in dollar terms by 35-50%, corporates are more and more thinking about end-user acquisition of the commercial real estate. Megafon&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of 49,99% stake in BC Oruzheyniy for USD 280 mln. is the bright example of such a practice in Q3 2015. Another interesting fact is high acquisition activity of retailers and production companies in I&amp;amp;amp;L segment: more than 200,000 sq m were acquired only via large transactions. &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   It is too early yet to talk about commercial real estate market recovery. However, the chances for this scenario are growing”. &#13;

Therefore, 41% of take-up relates to optimisation of costs and does not represent growth in the logistics market. Consequently, the vacancy rate remains high, and is impeding a recovery in rental rates. &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Moscow industrial market tendencies in Q3 2015:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Quarterly take-up amounted to 579,000 sq m and set an all-time record.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Q1-Q3 2015 take-up has exceeded 1 mln. sq m, which means that the level for the whole year may reach a record-breaking 1.2-1.4 mln. sq m, depending on the number of large deals closed in Q4.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New supply slightly exceeded 100,000 sq m. Another 44,000 sq m is to be delivered by the end of the year. As a result new supply for the year will reach 728,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy remains at 1 mln. sq m, representing 10.9% of the total stock.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average weighted rents declined by 6% compared to the previous quarter and fell to RUR 4,200 per sq m per annum.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt; TAKE-UP &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 579,000 sq m was taken-up in Q3 2015, which represents a historical high for the market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Take-up this year is likely to reach a record level of 1.2-1.4 mln. sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 FMCG and food retail companies (X5 Retail Group, Dixy and Lenta) were the most active on the demand side. Non-food and DIY retailers were second in terms of take-up. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;The largest deals in Q3 2015:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;X5 Retail Group became an anchor tenant in Logopark Sofyino with a lease of 65,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;FMCG and food retail chain DIXY signed two deals: a pre-sale contract in PNK-Severnoe Sheremetievo (55,000 sq m building to be constructed) in the northern part of the Moscow Region, and lease agreement of 54,000 sq m in the A-Terminal warehouse complex in the southern direction from Moscow. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Children's goods retailer Dochki-synochki leased 42,000 sq m in Logopark Bykovo (CORE.XP deal). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DIY-retailer OBI occupied warehouse space via a direct lease for the first time (35,000 sq m in Logopark Sever 2) instead of using its logistics provider's space (CORE.XP deal). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 There was demand on both the primary and secondary markets. However, only 40% of take-up resulted in a decrease in vacancy (completed buildings on the primary market and other vacant space on the open market). 37% of take-up was in properties which had not been previously marketed: where one occupier was immediately replaced by another or where an existing occupier/end-user took over a lease from the previous direct leaseholder.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 41% of take-up therefore relates to optimisation of costs and does not represent growth in the logistics market. This part of demand is the result of occupiers' reaction to current market conditions via a return from full 3rd party outsourcing to cheaper direct lease schemes or purchasing (on both the primary and secondary markets). As a result, despite the massive amount of take-up, the net absorption level in Q3 was 71% lower, and did not significantly influence the vacancy rate. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;SUPPLY&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Completions in Q3 2015 were minimal, with just two buildings being delivered (the first building in PNK-Chekhov 3 with an area of 100,000 sq m and building 9 in PNK-Chekhov 2 - 5,000 sq m).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 44,000 sq m has been announced for delivery in Q4. All of this space is being constructed for specific end-users. Total completions for the year are likely to reach 728,000 sq m, which is 55% less than in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 175,000 sq m is under construction and expected for delivery in Q1 2016. 86,000 sq m of this is available to the market. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;VACANCY RATES&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Vacant space totalled 1.035 mln. sq m by the end of Q3, representing 10.9% of the total warehouse stock in the Moscow Region, which is just slightly less than the one last quarter (11,7%). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;RENTAL RATES&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 By the end Q3 2015 the average weighted rent settled at RUR 4,200/sq m/year, i.e. it reached the lower end of the range seen in Q2 2015.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Rental rates continue to be under pressure from the strong competition in terms of supply. It comes from the fact that the amount of vacant space is equivalent to two years of 2015 absorption.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The average sale price settled at RUR 40,000-45,000 per sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Anton Alyabyev, Director of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics department, CORE.XP, Russia:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;The main factor fuelling demand is low market prices. Current commercial terms provide occupiers with the opportunity to optimize their logistics infrastructure on favourable commercial terms. Such a situation is reflected in the nature of take-up, where 50% of deals relate to existing secondary market properties.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The trend of moving from the use of 3rd party services to direct leasing/purchasing of premises is another consequence of the current market. As a result, take-up this year is likely to reach a record level of 1.2-1.4 mln. sq m. Nevertheless, this will not have significant positive impact on the market, because net absorption volumes remain low. Therefore, the vacancy rate remains high and is impeding a recovery in rental rates&amp;rdquo;. &#13;

In its recent Food and Beverage report, 67% of visitors to shopping centres had something to eat in the last 12 months, but only 7% rated their last F&amp;amp;amp;B visit as excellent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report highlights the requirement for better food and beverage quality. 45% want to see more healthy or organic food, with 43% looking for innovative offerings. Across the 22 markets across EMEA, there is a desire and willingness for new independent and pop-up/new concept restaurants (34%) and coffee shops (33%). &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Customers are becoming more discerning and are raising the bar in terms of expectations. They are becoming more engaged by quality and their expectations in terms of a well-rounded shopping centre &amp;lsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; is getting higher and higher. Customers are looking for the full retail experience where luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton sit comfortably alongside Gordon Ramsey. Currently there is a lack of parity and the growth of aspirational retail is not translating into the food and beverage offer in shopping centres.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The desire from consumers for newness and excitement has promoted some landlords to embrace the opportunity to try different concepts.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Peter Gold, Head of EMEA Cross Border Retail, CORE.XP said:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The concept of a food court has developed. The ‘new’ food court has to be supported by the provision of small ‘collections’ of operators in dedicated spaces around the centre or in having operators dotted between relevant retail brands. Retail brands are no longer hesitant as they once may have been about having a food operator next door. They see the benefit in someone perhaps taking time over an espresso to think over a purchase decision.” &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Michail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“While Russian consumers began to save on cafes and restaurants because of the crisis, shopping centers with F&amp;amp;amp;B operators will have higher traffic and be more attractive for customers. 30% of Russians visit shopping centers only in order to eat on food-court or in cafes and restaurants. So it’s not surprising, almost 15 new international F&amp;amp;amp;B chains entered the Russian market that during last two years, and existing market leaders continue active expansion. At the same time there is a growing role of quality and diversity of F&amp;amp;amp;B concepts, represented both on food-court or in the retail gallery of shopping center. This trend has already emerged in several Moscow shopping malls, where appeared new restaurants of high cuisine. However for the majority of shopping malls the most appropriate restaurants are of democratic format as it is targeted on mass market consumers.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The new warehouse is to be opened in Q3 2016. The decision to open this new warehouse was made due to business development plans as well as due to the need of modern automotive warehouse in the region that is equipped with engineering systems that are especially built for pharmaceutical goods storage. The development of this new logistics platform will allow ROSTA to reduce the time of order processing and to improve the quality of clients service.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of Industrial park PNK Valischevo is 500,000 sq m of high-quality warehouse premises. The construction of this park has started in 2015 and is being carried out using all the best European technology. The finish of construction of PNK Valischevo is planned for 2017-2018. Apart from the excellent location just in few kilometers from Simferopolskoye and Kashirskoye highways as well as in close proximity from the central round automobile road that is being constructed around Moscow, this industrial park is located near Domodedovo, Klimovsk and Podolsk. PNK Valischevo is also energy efficient park and meets NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) and FM Global standards. PNK Group&amp;rsquo;s projects are the only ones in Russia to meet these very strict requirements.&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Cannes - Moscow, 23 November 2015 - Worldwide sales of luxury goods continue to increase according to the latest report by global property advisor CORE.XP, Luxury Retail 2015. 70%* of all Chinese-led luxury purchases are now transacted overseas, resulting in sales increases in Western Europe of 13.4%, Eastern Europe 18%, Africa 26% and 5% in North America over the last two years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of Research and Consulting, EMEA, CORE.XP, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Chinese purchasers account for 30% of the luxury spend worldwide and 70% of these purchases take place overseas, showing that the downward shift in their economy has prompted Asian consumers to rethink their purchasing habits. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The advent of the new 'anti-extravagance legislation' in China and their consumers&amp;lsquo; growing awareness of price differentials of up to 70% has led to many preferring to make their purchases overseas, where the prices are far more attractive.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This shift in Chinese shopping habits is in turn providing opportunities for luxury brands to grow their presence across Europe and America, as they become the main hubs for luxury expansion over the next five years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“We will continue to see Europe and the US as key territories for luxury brands looking to expand. Many wealthy consumers from Asia and Africa want to make their luxury purchases in traditional luxury cities. They value the authenticity or added cachet that purchasing in Milan or New York offers.&amp;amp;quot; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2015, the top European target markets for luxury brand expansion was Germany with 46% of luxury brands establishing a new, or increasing their current, presence in the country. France and the United Kingdom were close behind with expansion 38% and 31% respectively.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps continues: “Germany, France and the United Kingdom remain critical for global luxury brands. The challenge is to find the optimum location in areas that are in extremely high demand.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Economically, the growth in personal affluence across the world has increased the need for global access to luxury products. With more people able to buy luxury goods, and luxury consumers willing to shop around (including travelling abroad) for the best deals and experience&amp;rdquo;, retailers have two key points of focus:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The shopping experience Retailers are realising that they need to be more capable of adapting to the needs of overseas customers venturing to Europe and elsewhere. In 2014, Nigerian visitors to the UK increased their retail spend by over 50%. They are now the 5th biggest spenders in London, purchasing on average four times as much as the UK shopper. It is no longer enough to have Mandarin-speaking staff, those with a grasp of Yoruba are also in high demand.&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  It is also not just about making specific purchases, consumers want to engage with the authentic brand experience that make them feel more valued.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Growth into new markets &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  As wealth gets spread more evenly across the world, Africa and India are surely the next to follow in China&amp;rsquo;s footsteps as major sources of luxury spending power.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&#13;
The embryonic African and Indian luxury markets are of interest thanks largely to the rise of disposable incomes and broadening younger consumer base willing to spend more on luxury goods. Key cities within both countries will continue to remain on the radar of prominent luxury retailers planning an expansion or entry into the country, however some impediments to growth, such as stock quality and high import duties will still remain.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Michail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Demand for luxury goods is able to deliver good stability even in crisis. Luxury clients are very rational, and, as a result, the major demand is concentrated in destinations with the lowest prices on respective goods: Milan and Paris. Respectively, quite often decline in sales of luxury retailers is caused not by the lack of demand, but by relatively ineffective pricing policy or/and too high taxes. After sharp Rouble depreciation by 100% since the beginning of the crisis, Moscow became very popular luxury shopping destination for the clients from China. As a result, Rouble sales of Russian luxury retailers may avoid decline in 2015.”&#13;

The European appetite for consumer goods continues to grow, resulting in e-commerce retailers expanding into new dedicated sites to meet this demand. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The industrial and logistics development pipeline in Europe largely remained stable in Q3. Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic continued to see large amounts of distribution space added to existing stock. The amount of speculative development across Europe, although increasing, remains limited due to the preference for bespoke hubs. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
On average, vacancy rates in the main European hubs are still between 5 and 7%, albeit there is little available space in the prime market segment. This has triggered an overflow into secondary properties and locations; however this space is predominantly being used for temporary surplus storage. The temporary nature of these occupiers means that empty warehouses are more easily filled, however for a shorter lease length and lower rental income.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Industrial investment has fallen considerably on a quarter by quarter basis, largely as a result of a quarterly sawtooth pattern in the UK, a market which is responsible for 40% of total investment in Europe. This pattern is caused by the closing of large portfolio deals, however the quarterly number of transactions has in fact remained stable and the moving quarterly average for investment in Europe has stayed at a record high of nearly &amp;euro;6bn.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental growth in EMEA has strengthened compared to previous quarters, but overall remains at a modest level. As in previous quarters, growth remains concentrated on locations where new development is harder to realise, particularly in the UK. The downward path of industrial yields is continuing and previously higher yielding markets such as France, Italy and Central European markets have moved in more clearly. The weighted average yield for EMEA has now dropped below 6.8%, and in most markets previous lows have now been reached or passed.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Machiel Wolters, Head of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Research, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;It is set to be a record year in terms of take up, as retail logistics operations continue to profit from strong consumption in Europe. Looking ahead, we expect to see more emphasis on last mile solutions, ideally modern parcel hubs around the big cities. Previously put off by their size, specific layouts and low ticket size, investors are now turning their attention to this asset class as reflected by a strong drop in yield levels.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabiev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In 2015, despite current crisis, take up activity in the I&amp;amp;amp;L segment is in the position to exceed the record figures of 2013, when this indicator reached 1.23 mln. sqm. As of the three quarters of 2015 take up has already amounted to 1.07 mln. sqm.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This fact has logical explanation despite looking fairly strange on the background of current decline in retail sales, which significantly exceeds 8% in real terms. Boost of the leasing activity is explained by the fact that both rental rates and sales prices for warehouses declined to its historical and cyclical lows. In addition, potential of their further decline seems fairly vague.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

In this situation large federal and international retailers decided to increase investments in development of their logistics system. The most active segments are food discounters, DIY, and kids goods retailers.”&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;France experienced the most noteworthy increase with investment activity of over €7 billion; almost double that of the same quarter in 2014. French investment activity was dominated by domestic investors who accounted for more than 70% of CRE investment in Q3, and who typically favoured large offices located in the Paris CBD.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Whilst France benefitted from the biggest change in investor sentiment, it was Germany which saw the greatest increase in absolute terms, with Q3 investment of €14 billion, up €5.6 billion on Q3 last year. The €36 billion already invested in German commercial real estate in the first three quarters of this year is 40% higher than the equivalent period in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Alongside France and Germany, several other countries experienced a strong Q3. Norway and Sweden saw Q3 investment volumes grow by 139% and 68% respectively on Q3 2014.  Southern Europe also performed well, with Portugal and Italy benefitting from a slight shift in investor focus away from the Spanish market.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Belgium attracted near record levels of investment in Q3, boosted by several large retail transactions. In Central and Eastern Europe, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary saw the most investment activity. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;At a city level, the most notable aspect in Q3 was the move of the Nordics up the table of Europe&amp;rsquo;s largest CRE investment markets with Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm making the top 10. Typically these Nordic capitals have very high levels of domestic investment (around 70%), with cross-border European investment accounting for around 25% and just 5% of capital coming from outside of Europe.  However in Q3 foreign investment accounted for more than half the total in both Oslo and Copenhagen.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London and Paris continue to fill the top two spots in the league table, but interestingly all five of the main German markets make it into the quarter’s top ten for the first time since Q1 2013.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We have seen good growth across the European commercial real estate investment market in the last quarter.  With high levels of transactions expected in Q4, this current trend is set to continue and we believe we will see a strong year-end in terms of investment volumes.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Retail recorded the strongest levels of investment growth this quarter up 45% on Q3 2014, the second highest level we have seen in ten years of data. The office sector also performed well across the region, underscored by some significant transactions in France, the UK, Norway and Sweden.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime yields continued to drive downwards, with substantial falls in several major markets in Q3.  Notably for all three main sectors the weighted average is now below its value in Q3 2007 – the pre-crisis low. The All Property average is down by 46 bps over the last four quarters and the rate of decline has accelerated in 2015, despite the growing expectation that short-term interest rates might finally start increasing in the next few months.   There are also some signs that the relationship between prime and secondary yields is stabilizing.  The prime-secondary spread had been closing rapidly since the end of 2013, but in the last two quarters it has been relatively stable.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;

    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In the period of January – November 2015 investments into Russian commercial real estate market amounted to €1.74 billion. This is 20% less compared to the same period of 2014, when this indicator was €2.17 billion.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“96% of investment activity is concentrated in Moscow. This is much higher than in prior years historically, when Russian regions (outside of Moscow) accounted for approximately 10% of total investments.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Mainly investors were focused on the office segment, which amounted to €969 mln., or 56% of the total investment volume. This can be explained by that fact that quality offices in the Central business district of Moscow indicated good resilience to crisis, with vacancy 4-5 percentage points lower than total office market average.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Following a strong first half, the German retail market overtook the UK to become the biggest in Europe. Q3 2015 was the strongest quarter on record for Germany since 2006. Shopping centres remain the preferred sector for cross regional investors, with retail warehouses increasing in popularity; attracting 24% of cross regional retail investment in Europe. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Nordic markets have also seen a high retail investment turnover so far this year; with investment in the first nine months of 2015 already more than double that of the whole of 2014. Despite a 12% increase to €4.3 billion from Q2 to Q3, the UK slipped behind Germany in terms retail investment turnover. The UK saw particularly high levels of retail warehouse investment, with over €1.5 million changing hands. After several consecutive weak quarters, the CEE reported significant uptick in investment, with €1.2 million invested in what was its strongest quarter for retail investment since 2011.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retail yields decreased in Q3 2015, with the CORE.XP EMEA Rental Yield Index down by 12 bps, leaving it 39 bps lower than in Q3 2014. Yield compression in several CEE markets this quarter (most pronounced in Czech Republic) means that yields fell faster outside the euro area than inside it. Shopping centre yields fell steadily throughout the quarter in European markets. With France, Portugal, Norway and Ireland experiencing the sharpest falls in Q3.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime high street retail rents were up by 0.5% Q-on-Q and have risen 6.7% year on year. There were marked increases in the Nordic markets, particularly Stockholm and Oslo. European shopping centre rents remained fairly steady with little movement since Q2.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
John Welham, Head of European Retail Investment, CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;After a strong performance throughout the year, Q3 2015 is the second strongest quarter on record, just behind Q4 2006. The German and Nordic markets have had an exceptional quarter. In Germany the growth was largely the result of an increase in activity by domestic purchasers. Local buyers invested €3.2 billion in the country, up 167% on the previous quarter. For the Nordics, attention was focussed on the high street offering in Oslo, the supermarket sector in Finland and domestic purchasers favouring retail warehouses and shopping centres in Sweden.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Director of Capital Markets Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In the contrast to Europe, investments into retail property market in Russia have stagnated since 2014. The only remarkable deal in 2015 is the acquisition of Shopping Center Modny Sezon, located right next to the Kremlin. Cumulative investments in this segment in January – November 2015 amounted to approximately $356 mln. Though this is 1.8 times more than in the same period of 2014, investment activity remains significantly lower in comparison to the pre-crisis years with the total retail investment volumes reaching $1.5 – 3 billion in 2011 -2013 annually.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nonetheless, growing expectations of future improvement in economic activity indicators, as well as commercial real estate repricing contribute to the return of investor appetite to the retail properties, with an anticipation to revert back to pre-cirisis investment activity in 2016.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

 Surgut City Mall totals 153,000 sq m (GBA) and 84,000 sq m (GLA). The shopping mall has an excellent transport access: it is located on the circle road around Surgut on the cross with the two major streets of the city: Engels and Dzerzhiskiy.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Mikhail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;ldquo;We have been working with Surgut City Mall from the beginning of its construction. That is why it is a pleasure for us that in 3 years since its grand opening it continues to develop. This is exactly the right thing to do, because only by reinforcement of the current tenant mix and their rotation, the shopping mall can attract new brands that are suitable for the city and this allows the mall to keep its leading status in the market of Surgut and the region as a whole.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Across 47 European cities, the majority - 69% - are now showing stable or declining office vacancy rates. As a result aggregate vacancy across the region is now at its lowest level for four years. This trend is most pronounced in Warsaw which recorded one of the largest reductions in vacancy rates, falling by over 1pp to 12.9%, in the third quarter. This marks the lowest vacancy rate since the first quarter of 2014 in the Polish capital. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In contrast, only 15 office markets - 31% - saw any upward movement in vacancy levels. Helsinki recorded the highest growth with levels rising by 1.5pp to 14.5% in the third quarter, marking its third consecutive quarter of growth in vacancy rate.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton, EMEA Head of Occupier Research, at CORE.XP explains:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;We are now seeing strong declines in office vacancy levels across EMEA. Paris, Frankfurt, Brussels and London&amp;rsquo;s West End office market all saw vacancy rates decline in the last quarter with even stronger falls seen in Madrid, Budapest and Dublin. The best office buildings and locations are getting secured quickly, heightened by the office development pipeline seeing a slowdown in growth. Year-to-date office completions for core EMEA markets are 7.2% lower than in the same period last year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“These two factors are supporting the acceleration of prime office rents. For instance Dublin’s rents are now almost double their cyclical low of 2012. Rents in other markets, including Stockholm and Barcelona, are rising at a rate of 10% per year or more.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Claudia Chistova, Head of Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Opposite trends were observed in Moscow office market during 2015. The vacancy reached the highest level, the rent continued to decrease. By the year-end the vacancy is expected to reach 16-17%. Class A vacancy may peak at 27-28%, or 1 mln. sq m. By the end of 2016 limited supply will drive vacancy down. In the current market conditions, the development of new office projects that would be commissioned in 2017&amp;ndash;2018 are being put on hold. According to our forecast, the total delivery for 2017-2018 will not exceed 0.5 mln. sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In 2015 rents continued to decrease. Rents went down by 10-15% in 2015 or by 25-35% compared to the rents at the beginning of 2014. The prime area is the only submarket where available office space is offered for lease in dollars. Asking rents in the Prime class A segment are $800–900/sq m per year, net of OpEx and VAT, class A rental rates – RUB 19,000–25,000, class B rental rates – RUB 13,000 – 23,000. In 2016 rents are expected to remain stable. If the overall macroeconomic and geopolitical situation is positive, we don’t exclude rouble rental rates growth on the back of high inflation.”&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow, 23 December 2015, &amp;mdash; London&amp;rsquo;s West End was the world’s highest-priced office market for the second straight year and Hong Kong Central, Beijing Finance Street Beijing Central Business District and Hong Kong West Kowloon, took four of the top five most expensive spots in the rankings, according to CORE.XP Research’s semi-annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs survey. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London’s West End topped the &amp;ldquo;most expensive&amp;rdquo; list, with overall prime occupancy costs of US$273 per sq. ft. per year. Hong Kong (Central) followed, with prime occupancy costs of US$269 per sq. ft. Beijing (Finance Street), at US$191 per sq. ft., Beijing (Central Business District (CBD), at US$183 per sq. ft., and Hong Kong (West Kowloon), at US$162 per sq. ft., rounded out the top five. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime occupancy costs—which reflect rent, plus local taxes and service charges—increased at a 2.4 percent annual pace globally, as the world economy continued to gradually improve and the service sector, a key bellwether for prime office space, entered its fourth year of expansion, driving healthy demand for space in top-quality properties.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the Americas, prime occupancy costs increased by 3.1 percent year-over-year, largely thanks to the U.S., where rising office-using employment growth stimulated demand for commercial real estate nationwide, including in some key non-gateway and suburban markets. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime occupancy costs in EMEA rose 2.2 percent following economic recovery, while costs in Asia Pacific increased by 1.9 percent.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The global services sector has grown steadily for four years now, which helps to explain the general uplift in office rents and costs we are seeing worldwide,” said Richard Barkham, global chief economist, CORE.XP. “Despite the fact that some markets have been hit by the China, oil and commodities slowdowns, we expect that most advanced economies will keep growing in 2016 and 2017, which combined with limited availability and relatively muted development levels, will result in moderate 2 percent to 3 percent cost increases.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP tracks occupancy costs for prime office space in 126 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 19 were in EMEA, 20 were in Asia Pacific and 11 were in the Americas. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Thirty-three markets in EMEA notched increases in occupancy costs as the region’s economic recovery continued to take hold, with 65 percent of European markets moving up by more than three places in the rankings. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Four of the rising markets—Prague, Warsaw, Bucharest, Belgrade—were in Central Europe, which has performed better because of the pick-up in the Eurozone and the benefits it offers in terms of a low-cost location for manufacturing and service sector activity. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Office rent values also significantly increased in several U.K. regional cities, including Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Southampton and Belfast, providing evidence of an increasingly positive supply-demand balance for U.K. markets outside London. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Claudia Chistova, Head of Research Department in CORE.XP, Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“By the end of 2015 Moscow has lost its position in the world’s ten most expensive cities and dropped to number 11. Though at the end of 2014 Moscow had the 5th position in the ranking. This is a result of further rents decrease. Prime class A rents went down by 10% during 2015 or by 15-25% compared to the beginning of 2014. Currently, prime class A rents are $800-900 net of OpEx and VAT. Offices in the prime A market segment are under pressure due to the extremely limited level of demand for such space. During three quarters of 2015 the total volume of new lease deals done in the prime class A segment accounted for 20,000 sq m (4% of the total volume of new leases in Moscow), the volume of lease renewals and renegotiations totaled 64,000 sq m (16 % of the total). As a general trend in Moscow office market companies prefer to fix better commercial terms for the short term in their existing business centres. This is largely due to the fact that the end of the crisis is not obvious and it is difficult for companies to plan their future business development.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Asia Pacific was home to seven of the top 10 most expensive markets globally—Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Beijing (CBD), Hong Kong (West Kowloon), New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD), Tokyo (Marunouchi Otemachi) and Shanghai (Pudong). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Shanghai (Pudong) moved into the top 10 globally, rising two places to the ninth spot. Despite the Chinese economic slowdown, demand from financial services firms for prime space in Pudong remains strong and supply remains limited.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong (Central) remained the only market in the world—other than London’s West End— with a prime occupancy cost exceeding US$200 per sq. ft. However, there is some evidence that overseas financial services companies are resistant to continued high costs and may be seeking alternative to a Hong Kong location.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
New York (Midtown) retained its spot in 10th place and remained the most expensive Americas market, with a prime office occupancy cost of US$127 per sq. ft.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tech-focused markets continued to fare well, with Seattle (Downtown) topping the global list of increases in occupancy costs, up 17.3 percent year-over-year, and prime costs continuing to rise in San Francisco despite an increase in the supply of Class A product. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Prime occupancy costs grew in a host of key cities and suburban markets—including Washington, D.C. (Downtown), San Francisco (Peninsula), Seattle (Downtown), Seattle (Suburban), Atlanta (Downtown) and Atlanta (Suburban)—evidencing the growing breadth and depth of the recovery of the office market in the U.S. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Latin America, Lima, Monterrey, Buenos Aires and Mexico City rose up the ranks, showing that the troubles being felt by Brazil are not typical of the whole region.&#13;

Czech Republic and Poland put in a particularly strong performance, recording investment volumes of €2.7 billion and €4 billion respectively.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Most of the CEE countries performed strongly in 2015, with strong growth in transaction volumes in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Serbia.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The high appetite for good retail products, evident from 2013 and 2014 translated into strong numbers in 2015. For the first time, retail accounts for 43% of the total investment volume for CEE. This y-o-y increase is substantial &amp;ndash; over 160% and is based on a multitude of big-size investment deals done for prime, dominant shopping centers located in Czech Republic and Poland. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investment into core-CEE countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania) reached €8.4 billion in 2015, a 14% increase on 2014 numbers and well above the forecast numbers. Poland&amp;rsquo;s stellar performance is a testament to the country’s outstanding macro-economic growth and stability. For Czech Republic growth came on the back of two large investment deals signed in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hungary’s investment volume, up 42% y-o-y, is set to rise in 2016 as investors are showing increasing interest in making investments. Transactions could go towards the dominant retail sector, where retail turnovers have risen by double digits in some areas. The drop in investment volume for Romania should be seen in the context of an unusually strong 2014, driven mainly by one major one-off deal. Excluding this effect, Romania's performance was robust and on par with expectations. Looking ahead, Romania and Slovakia are earmarked for success with increased interest being shown from investors. Larger deals are expected to be seen in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia with investors looking to have a presence in these markets. &#13;

Gijs Klomp, Head of CEE Investment Properties, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;This year we have seen strong investment into the region as investors from within Europe are looking to take advantage of relatively high yields and strength of available stock on the market. In 2016 we expect this to continue as the stage is set for strong economic growth in the CEE, relatively high yields compared to Western Europe and increasing interest from banks to finance in the region. In addition, another major factor which will contribute to higher interest is the strong expansion seen in the retailers’ reported sales across the region. We also expect to see an increasingly diverse investor profile as Asian investors aim to increase their presence within the area.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Although investment volume into Russian retail property in 2015 at €497 mln; was 3 times higher than in 2014, it was still 3 times lower than €1.6 billion recorded annually in 2011-2013 on average. The major constraints for the investment deals in retail segment was operating income correction which happened during first half of 2015 with following repricing of the assets reflecting ongoing economic turbulence and cost of debt finance. The rouble devaluation as well as expensive banking finance which motivated investors to even consider full equity deals has made the average deal size 3 times lower, at €44 mln in 2014-2015 vs €133 mln in 2011-2013.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite overall instability, we are witnessing growing interest for retail segment both from local and international investors who generally have two investment strategies, either interested in buying core income producing assets, or high yielding high risk assets with leasing upside or debt distress. The driver for investing into retail property is sector recovery potential in the future after correction of asset volume in 2015.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The survey, now in its sixth year, polls real estate decision makers at 120 global corporations to understand their objectives and associated challenges across a broad range of issues. The respondents represent companies headquartered primarily in Western Europe or North America spanning multiple sectors, of which the largest are: manufacturing, banking and finance, professional services and, healthcare and life sciences.&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Richard Holberton, EMEA Head of Occupier Research, at CORE.XP commented:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;A significant overhead, and in many cases the largest, for a company is the cost of its people. Increasingly companies want to maximise the return on human capital by providing workspaces that promote choice, collaboration and high levels of employee satisfaction, to attract the best staff and to support their brand. Likewise, employees want a voice &amp;ndash; whether that’s the location of work, flexible working or a say in the office layout. This means there is ongoing recognition that the workplace must provide a high quality experience to entice and retain staff.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“It’s therefore not surprising that 74% of companies report having a wellness programme, two thirds see labour and skills as important factors in global location strategies, and a further 67% believe deploying a workplace strategy enables better collaboration with customers and colleagues.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Underpinning the workplace agenda is the increasing focus on performance – both people and property – to drive better business outcomes. Central to this is the importance of data: 75% of companies now regard better, and more accurate, data as the single most important factor in supporting corporate real estate strategy and identifying new opportunities.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite concerns surrounding the macroeconomic environment - 58% cite economic uncertainty as a key challenge – anxieties about cost management have diminished in the last year. 41% of companies, down from half (50%) in 2014, see this as one of their main business challenges. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton added:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In recent years we’ve seen some substantial shifts regarding corporate real estate (CRE) strategy drivers. Companies have lived through the recession and, at varying speeds, recovery. For a while cost management dominated, and then as conditions eased workforce issues and growth came to the fore.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Today, we are seeing that both agendas are still important but the next challenge is more complex. Companies need to fine tune policies to optimise the performance of both people and space. In an environment where economic uncertainty is still a concern, and the CRE function is looking to become more aligned with strategic business objectives, the need for accurate and smart performance data analytics will grow.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Considering all business priorities in office space organization in the European capitals, optimization of working space in order to increase employee engagement and improve efficiency becomes number one priority. Unfortunately, this trend is not typical for the Moscow office market. Although it should be noted representatives of big international companies have started to introduce such projects due to the fact that the strategy is adopted on the global level. According to survey conducted among tenants in the first half of 2015, the layout of the office space occupied ranks third among the desired improvements; the first place - the work of the management company, the second - provision of infrastructure. According to the survey results, the majority of companies are not ready to grant employees remote access in order to reduce the cost of leasing office space. Also, tenants are not willing to use the concept of &amp;amp;quot;desk-sharing&amp;amp;quot; (workplace that are not reserved for certain employee and may be used by any employee), only 36% of companies surveyed replied positively. Comparing to international survey the Moscow results appear conservative, which shows dramatically reversed results. Internationally for remote access 80% of the respondents replied positively and more than 60% for desk-sharing.”&#13;

These factors have led to the main trend in 2015 - the period of shopping centre populating with tenants has increased and the vacancy rate has gone up to 9.5%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Low consumer purchasing power forced retailers and suppliers to control prices &amp;ldquo;manually&amp;rdquo;. However, new cycle of price growth can begin in 2016 due to a new round of rouble devaluation and existing product embargo. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The total stock of modern retail space in Moscow reached 5.2 mln. sq m, or 424 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants. As some projects&amp;rsquo; openings have been postponed to 2016, the pace of completions have slowed down, the actual new supply was 40% lower than the forecast announced in the beginning of 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Despite some negative macroeconomic factors, international retailers are still interested in the Russian market. 40 international retailers entered the Moscow market in 2015, with ASUS Republic of Gamers, Mafrat, Malo, Orient, Seiko, Tchibo, Wrangler among examples. 40% of new retail chains opened their first stores in the shopping centres delivered in 2015 (Aviapark, Tsentralny Detsky Magazin on Lubyanka, Kuntsevo Plaza) and in the most popular high street retail destinations (20%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 At the same time, due to optimization of development strategy, 11 international retailers left the Russian market during the year. The most &amp;lsquo;painful’ for the market were exits of such retail chains as Stockmann, Camaieu, Lindex and Rockport. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The trend of technical openings and the growth of average vacancy rate due to reducing retailers&amp;prime; activity increase the interest of developers to unusual tenants. For example, in some shopping malls chain retailers were replaced with private entrepreneurs. Some unusual formats like farmers markets, dancing studios, art galleries, interactive theatres, quests appeared in shopping malls. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;The key trends of the retail property market for 2016:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In 2016 prices will continue to rise under the pressure of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. In this case, major grocery retail chains and retailers of “middle &amp;ndash;“ and “economy” price segments will keep strong market positions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers announce the delivery of 17 shopping malls with a total rentable area of 560,000. However, due to the high level of uncertainty and risk on the demand side, openings of new projects even at a high stage of construction could be postponed by 1-2 quarters. As a result, the actual completions will reach 60-70% of announced retail schemes.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the amount of new supply in 2016 remains comparable to 2015 figure, and retailers activity remains low, the average vacancy rate could rise from current 9.5% to 11% by the end of 2016.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average vacancy rate in shopping centres delivered in 2014-2015 continues to decline and may reach 15-17%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The most expected projects in 2016 are Riviera, Riga Mall, Galereya Kutuzovsky, Polezhaevsky, Butovo Mall, Kosino Park and the 2nd phase of Metropolis. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At least 10 new international retailers have announced their plans to enter the Moscow market in 2016, including such retail chains as John Varvatos, Kidzania, Superdry, Tallinder, Victoria’s Secret Pink.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;By the end of 2015, most retailers have revised development strategies for 2016, which implies not only the closure or reduction of stores but also further chain development. For example, further expansion announced such key market players as OBI, Leroy Merlin, Decathlon, fashion retailers (H&amp;amp;amp;M, Mango, Uniqlo, Mango, Monki, Forever 21), and popular fast-food chains (McDonald’s, KFC, Baskin Robbins, Hesburger, Subway, Nathan’s Famous).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers will continue to strengthen the entertainment component of shopping malls to attract new consumers. Most likely, new edutainment formats as well as innovative entertainment concepts for teenagers and adults will appear in 2016.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Michael Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia, comments: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “As a result of the economic crisis, access to financial instruments for the developers became prohibitively expensive, and start of new projects became unprofitable. Thus, probability of new shopping malls development starts during 2016 is very low. Projects at an advanced stage of construction with secured financing will be completed with high certainty. The same is true to the developers that will be able to find co-investor, for example large retailer. Increased competition together with declined retail sales may encourage some owners to conduct a re-conception, tenant rotation or re-positioning of their schemes. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 There is still an imbalance between supply and demand in the Moscow retail property market: new delivery of shopping malls exceeds absorption of retail space. Thus, vacancy rate will continue increasing and could reach 11% in 2016. In 2017 after twofold reduction of completions and given economic recovery, the vacancy rate could start declining.” &#13;

This has set the trend for 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Major characteristics of the city’s office market in 2015:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up (new lease and sale deals) amounted to 870,400 sq m (18% higher than in 2014). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Largest share of Class A transactions in the history of the Moscow office market &amp;ndash; 43%, previously it has never exceeded 41%. However, Class A volume in absolute terms, 373,400 sq m, is the largest only for the last four years.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The volume of renewals and renegotiations reached a historic high, 566,000 sq m: companies preferred to fix better commercial terms for the short-term in their existing business centres. However, these types of transactions in such a large volume ended in 2015.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The volume of new office delivery in 2015 amounted to 721,500 sq m, which is almost twice less than in 2014 and 2015 forecasts at the beginning of 2015 (1.4 mln sq m). The largest Class A office buildings delivered in 2015 were Oruzheiny 41 in the CBD (100,000 sq m), Evolution in Moscow-City (79,000 sq m); and in Class B – Neo Geo at Butlerova Street (110,000 sq m), Sirius Park at Kashirskoe Highway (66,000 sq m), Simonov Plaza at Leninskaya Sloboda Street (49,000 sq m).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Overall vacancy increased from 16.6% in 2014 to 17.7% in 2015; from 12.8% to 14.8% in Class B and decreased from 28% to 26% in Class A.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The main trend of 2015 is the final transition of lease rates to Roubles. If in H1 2015 Class B was predominantly characterized by Rouble rates, then in Q4 the trend spread to Class A.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
A significant share of the total take-up involved state institutions and companies with government involvement, for example, Moscow Government subsidiaries in OKO, Moscow Region Government structures in Orbita, Transneft in Evolution.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There are 0.6 mln sq m of office projects announced for delivery in 2016, of which 0.32 mln sq m is Class A offices, and 0.28 mln sq m is Class B. Over 30% of the announced volume is expected for commissioning in Moscow-City: IQ-quarter and the Federation Tower East, and the volumes of new delivery will return to the level of 2012.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP’s forecast, in 2016 the volume of transactions is expected to remain at the level of 2015, 0.8 mln sq m.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The vacancy rate is expected to stabilise at the level of 16–17% overall, 24–25% in the class A segment, 13–14% in the class B segment.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The main trend of 2015 was the final transition of lease rates to Roubles. The only submarket where landlords still continue to offer the premises in rents, denominated in Dollars, is Prime Class A segment ($800–900 per sq m per year net of OpEx and VAT).&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Rental rates by the year-end (sq m, net of OpEx and VAT)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;

According to our forecast, rental rates denominated in Rubles will at least remain stable during 2016.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elena Denisova, Director of Office Agency, CORE.XP in Russia commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Despite decrease in the volume of new office construction and rental decrease, Moscow office market observed positive changes: demand remained active and take-up exceeded the 2014 results. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2016 among the major trends the conclusion of large new lease transactions cannot be excluded, including continuing demand from state institutions and state owned companies. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
We expect that 2016 will be the last period when the current market opportunities can be secured. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
It is also anticipated that extension and renegotiation deals will not be executed on such large volume in 2016. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Lease rates denominated in Roubles appear to reach bottom in 2015, however the bottom is not reflected on the asking rates, but rather can be clearly perceived through actually achieved transactions.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

Demand and supply misbalance resulted in vacancy level that is more typical for mature markets. Vacancy level has provoked the substantial decrease in rental rates thus cutting off the market the non-system developers in terms of the efficiency. This is mainly reflected in the volume of speculative development. About 686,000 sq m in total are announced to be completed in 2016, and only half of this is available to the market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;SUPPLY&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The total completions for 2015 reached 694,000 sq m, 57% less than in 2014. The only project of 10,000 sq m was delivered in Q4 2015 - a stand-alone project for an end-user. In contrast to 2014, there were no speculative projects delivered in Q4 2015. 686,000 sq m in total are announced to be completed in 2016, and only half of this is available to the market. For example, among the key projects to be opened in 2016 are Leroy Merlin distribution centre (100,000 sq m) in South Gate Industrial Park and Magnit distribution centre (56,000 sq m) in Orudievo.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;DEMAND&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The share XXL-deals (more than 30,000 sq m) reached almost 50%. Due to attractive commercial terms occupiers were actively consolidating warehouse premises during the year. And this process is not completed yet, and will continue in 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The major occupiers are the retail companies, totaling 51% of the annual demand.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Several major deals were closed with retailors in 2015: Dochki &amp;ndash;synochki leased 42,203 sq m of warehouse premises in modern Class A warehouse complex Logopark Bykovo located in Moscow Region, along Novoryazanskiy highway and OBI signed a direct lease agreement for 35,765 sq. m of warehouse premises in a modern Class A+ warehouse complex Logopark-Sever -2 in the North of Moscow Region.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the geopolitical situation, demand share of foreign companies is maintained at the usual level of about 30%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;VACANCY RATE&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The vacancy rate is settled at 1 mln. sq m by the end of 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
By the end of Q4 2015 vacant premises totaled 1.07 mln sq m, representing 11.2% of the warehouse stock in the Moscow Region. The vacancy increase was insignificant, only 0,27 ppts. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;COMMERCIAL TERMS &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The average rental rent in 2016 is expected to be RUB 4,200/sq m/year, same level as it was in Q4 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Average sale price will stay at RUB 40,000 -45,000 per sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rental rates were indexed in accordance with the Russian consumer price index, but not more than 10%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;KEY TRENDS OF THE WAREHOUSE AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY MARKET FOR 2016:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand level will be the key characteristics of the market in 2016. Thus not only its absolute amount, but also its structure will affect the market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Annual take-up is expected at 1 mln sq m. About a half of it (400,000-500,000 sq m) will represent the growth of the market, while other transactional activity will be represented by optimization of currently occupied space.&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  We expect the retail companies to continue consolidation of warehouses. Low prices and large variety of market options are still shaping potential for big deals.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  Development was under pressure of low rental rates. The construction cost savings and the increase of construction efficiency will continue. This will ease speculative development. Annual completions in 2016 are expected at 600,000-700,000 sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  Vacancy rate will be slightly decreasing throughout 2016, but will stay in the range of 9-10%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  Anton Alyabyev, Director, Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Agency Services, CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;ldquo;The 2015 results have demonstrated high business activity, which is definitely a positive signal. During the year the demand was very high, and by the end of the 2015 the take-up totaled 1.2 mln sq m, which was almost equal to historical maximum of 2013. From the market perspective, this situation means that business has an experience of going through the crises effectively. Now the companies are taking advantage of the new market opportunities competently, and are consolidating logistics space with comfortable commercial terms. This trend, set in 2015, will continue in 2016. As a result, the Moscow region take-up in 2016 is expected not less than 1 mln sq m.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

The main driver for investors now is the potential of asset value recovery on the back of market correction.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Key indicators in 2015:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The investment into real estate assets was down by 36% YoY in US dollar terms and amounted to USD2.8 bn. However, the investment volume in ruble terms was the same as in 2014 and amounted to RUB168 bn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The re-pricing is happening because of FX market volatility, structural change of leasing income, and high cost of debt. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investors have several strategies now, the purchase of quality income producing assets or assets with leasing income upside. At the same time, investors are particularly interested in assets with high debt burden, if there are prospect for debt optimization or owner&amp;rsquo;s strategic decision to sell at the current level.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
The investment market in 2015 was as liquid as in 2014, with the same number of deals, because of ruble devaluation the average investment deal size declined to USD55 m from USD85 m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Foreign investment share declined to 15% in 2015 from 33% in 2014. Regional investments amount to a mere USD58.7 mln, or about 2% of the total 2015 volume, reflecting the investor interest to Moscow.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Offices continued to be the investor priorities, with 38% of 2015 volume. Key transactions are the sales of Metropolis business centre, bld. 1 and 3, Avrora business centre and Zarechiye business centre.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The investors’ demand for shopping centres and warehouses in 2015 took 25% and 18% of the total volume accordingly. Among the largest deals in these segments were the purchase of Fashion Season Gallery and PNK Chekhov I logistic complex.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
11% of the total volume was invested into hotels. The key contributors to this were the sale of Four Seasons Hotel Moscow and Sheraton Palace hotel.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the uncertainty on the market, investors see the benefits of investing at market bottom and advantage over other asset types in the form of value retention in the long term. As the current oil price level is prohibitive for its producers, we expect the situation to change and stabilization on real estate investment market to start during H1 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;High investor interest to commercial real estate is demonstrated by the deal volume in negotiation stage. Notably, the interest is presented not only by Russian capital that has been dominating on investment market recently, but also by the interest of foreign investors, including Asian and Middle Eastern, which has not realized yet. Taking into account the amount of deals that have been postponed from 2015 to 2016 and high investor interest, we forecast 30% real estate investment growth in ruble terms in 2016, with the investment volume in dollar terms remaining at the 2015 level&amp;rdquo;.&#13;

The re-entry of core funds like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs indicate increasing investor confidence in CEE. Germany was the second largest investor, accounting for 23% of all investment into the region last year, an increase from 12% in 2014.

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
The high levels of investment in 2015 did impact yields pushing them down. Cross-regional disparities in terms of pricing need to be assesed – while certain markets and sectors have almost reached the yields from the previous peak economic cycle (most notably Czech Republic and Poland), other countries have yet to reach their potential. As investment transactions for prime properties do not show any signs of slowing down, CORE.XP believes some markets may even see yields moving into a new territory, beyond those from 2007. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
While outlook for 2016 is positive, a potential deterrent to the substantial growth in investment volume might be the scarcity of attractive product, available for transaction. As a consequence, office development in Warsaw and Bucharest is at record levels, making use of investors&amp;lsquo; and occupiers‘ interest in the markets. &#13;

Gijs Klomp, Head of CEE Investment Properties, CORE.XP commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The strong investment volumes within the region are a result of US and German investors looking to take advantage of relatively high yields and strength of available stock on the market. In 2016 we expect this to continue as the stage is set for strong economic growth in the CEE, with relatively high yields compared to Western Europe and increasing interest from banks to finance in the region. In addition, the strong expansion seen in the retailers’ reported sales across the region will continue to keep retail investors interested. We also expect to see an increasingly diverse investor profile as Asian investors begin to increase their presence within the area&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Director of Capital Markets Department, СBRE in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The record high volume into commercial real estate in Western Europe (especially in the UK, Germany and France) – the 2014-2015 volume were up 73% compared to 2012-2013 – has led to yield compression on those markets. As a result the capital shifted towards Eastern Europe, where markets offer higher level of return on investment compared to Western. Similar shift has been recorded in 2005-2007, when American and western European capital started investing in Russia. Nevertheless, because of geopolitical situation the Western capital is refraining from transacting in Russia this time, despite the corrected values and increased level of yields, which are offered by the local market. With this background, Asian and Middle Eastern investors are interested in Russian market, finding good opportunities in terms of yield level vs asset quality.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
When selecting a destination for their first store opening, 82% of retailers select prime locations 77% choose shopping centres, and 78% opt for a capital city. The second option for retailers, especially those in Luxury and Business sector, is to opt for High Street or Shopping Galleries as the first location.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Romania and Slovakia, the favorite destination for new brands is by far the shopping centre. In Czech Republic and Poland, the destination choice is more balanced between shopping centres and the high street. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
While capital cities are clearly a favorite, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that regional cities are ignored – Poland, with its extensive high-quality regional retail stock, attracts up to 40% of new comers into regional locations- the highest penetration rate in regional areas out of all core CEE countries. In other countries the range is from 5 to 20%. Some of the most attractive regional cities are: Ł&amp;oacute;dz, Wrocław, Poznan in Poland, Timișoara, Iași, Ploiești in Romania, Ko&amp;scaron;ice in Slovakia and Debrecen in Hungary.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New entrants range from luxury retailers, like Brioni, Moncler, Stuart Weitzman, to affordable luxury, like Michael Kors or Tosca Blu. Mass market fashion comprises brands such as Sinsay and Mohito. Homeware brands Tiger and English Home and coffee and restaurant brands such as Dunkin Donuts and Patisserie Paul have also entered the CEE retail market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Romania attracted the highest number of new brands (34%), followed by Poland (25%). Czech Republic is “the destination” within CEE for luxury tenants – half of new entries from this segment chose Prague as first entry point. Hungary is the target for Coffee &amp;amp;amp; Restaurants outlets, especially from the fast food industry and while Slovak consumers are fashion oriented, the majority of new brands are from the midrange fashion category. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Walter W&amp;ouml;lfler, Senior Director, Head of Retail CEE, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Looking ahead we expect to see more international brands attracted to the CEE region as a future retail destination. This will be largely due to strong macro-economic indicators, an increase in consumer spending, quality retail space and income availability for purchases. In terms of type of retailers and type of operation, the existing patterns will mostly continue in the coming period – fashion brands, franchisees, and European names will lead the expansion model in CEE.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the negative economic conditions in 2015 new retail chains continue to show interest in the Russian retail market. 29 new international retailers opened their first stores in the Russian regions during 2013-2015, such as Polo Ralph Lauren, Violetta by Mango, Euroshop, Saint James, Pimkie, L&amp;acute;Agent by L´Agent Provocateur and others. This choice is mainly due to lower rental rates, comparable level of quality supply and high purchasing power. During the last three years, new international retailers have entered the Russian market in Barnaul, Krasnodar, Kazan, Novosibirsk and others.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Michael Rogozhin, Managing director of Retail Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“If geo-political and economic conditions improve in 2016-2018, new international retail chains will continue to enter the market and develop. By the end of 2015 commercial terms for tenants significantly improved compared to the pre-crisis situation. For example, some retailers managed to change the principle of rent mechanism from the fixed rent to the share of turnover or switch dollar rates into rubles. Moreover, the amount of available alternative locations to place a shop has significantly increased, partly due to the openings of new retail schemes. It is likely that commercial terms in 2016-2017 will remain favorable for tenants, at least, during 2016, fueled by still high vacancy rate in the Moscow shopping centres. This might provide quite a strong incentive for new retail players, despite the rather weak consumer demand.”&#13;

According to the latest retail research &amp;laquo;How active is the Russian Retail Market?&amp;raquo; by global property advisor CORE.XP, new market entrants have opened around 390 new stores since the beginning of 2013 and are planning to open, at least, 70 more by the end of 2016. For example, such retail chains as Dippin Dots, Krispy Kreme, Takko Fashion, Anta Sports, Bimbus, Deichmann, Forever 21, Monki, and Derimod have already announced further development in Russia.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Over 52 new brands entered the Russian market in 2015. This is only 2 brands less than a year earlier. 12 new retail chains have announced plans to enter the Russian market in 2016. &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP research, 31% of most active brands are retail chains of fashion segment. In 2015 such chains as Circle of Gentlemen and Wrangler opened their first monostores in Russia. Malo, Henry Cotton&amp;rsquo;s, MCS, Nelva, andTsumori Chisato also entered the Russian market. Usually new players open 2-3 stores at once. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite Moscow is the first city to open in 85%, 17 new retail chains opened their first stores in the Russian regions. This choice is mainly due to lower rental rates, comparable level of quality supply and relatively high purchasing power. &#13;

&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;During 2013-2015, 2014 was the most active year for new entries when 54 new brands entered the market. In 2015, despite negative economic conditions, the activity of international retail chains and the interest to Russian retail market have been saved. 52 new brands have entered the market during the year. Nearly 60% of new players are retail chains of middle and budget price segments. Consumer goods of these segments are in high demand in Russia. The decrease in real disposable income causes an increased demand for new budget brands. New retail chains will highly likely continue to enter the market in 2016 and develop as consumer demand stabilizes, both in Moscow and in regional markets. We expect in 2016–2017 about 30 new brands to enter the Russian market. In fact, this figure could be higher&amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Growth will be a key theme in the region in 2016 as economic recovery happens at a quicker pace than in Western European countries.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The dominant factor impacting the property market is consumer spending, which is currently benefiting from a host of positive factors, including low oil and commodity prices, low interest rates, falling unemployment and rising house prices. This rise in private consumption has triggered a wave of new developments, in the form of retail schemes and logistic warehouses driven by ecommerce. This consumer appetite has already led to increased turnover volumes and a stabilised operating income for retail properties, thus investment attractivness is high. Apart from traditional destinations (such as Prague and regional Poland), Bucharest and Budapest should be on the investors list, giving a significant boost to retail investment in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As investment transactions for prime properties do not show any signs of slowing down, we might see yields moving into a new territory, beyond those from 2007. Albeit, compression will move at a slower pace than in 2015, capital value growth will be reached through cap rates compression and less through rental growth. Even in the context of yield compression, the spread compared to government bonds continues to be very generous, thus real-estate in CEE will be a solid alternative for institutional investors. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Office-wise, demand is at record levels, driven largely by IT &amp;amp;amp; outsourcing occupiers, a majority of which are international. The pipeline for the entire region is at rather low levels, with two major exceptions: Warsaw has over 670,000 sq m of new space scheduled for delivery in the next 2 years (which amounts to 15% of existing stock). The other star is Bucharest, with an even higher rate of pipeline versus stock (21%), which will put significant pressure on net effective rents and vacancy rates. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Overall, the CEE office sector is a tenant’s market, a trend set to continue in the next 12 – 24 months. With the number of available options in the capital cities sizable (in some cases only growing), tenants are taking advantage of good or very good financial conditions made available to them.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
We start off 2016 with a buoyant retail market and rising consumer confidence. As retail densities are already high in some markets, pipeline is limited. Only three capital cities in CEE are scheduled to see new shopping centers in 2016: one is Bucharest, another is Kiev (where four centers are planned for opening, but delays most likely to occur); the last is Warsaw with a new stock for 2016 of almost 72,000 sq m. Regional areas in CEE will be more active in terms of new development, most notably the 98,000 sq m scheme in Poznan; the biggest shopping centre to open in Poland in the last seven years. Pipeline is completly dry in Slovakia and Hungary. In total we expect around 972,000 sq m of new shopping centre space to come to market, which is below previous years’ levels. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Overall, 2015 was an exceptional year in terms of take-up for the logistics sector, as retail logistic operators are taking advantage of the increase in consumer demand, driven both via traditional ways of retailing, but also via e-commerce. All markets record take-up levels that are well above 10 year averages, some as high as up 65%. Development wise, we are seeing limited speculative construction, the market is driven by built-to-suit (BTS) schemes. Exception to the rule is Poland – where almost 900,000 sq m is under construction as of early 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report highlights Hungary, as a country that has flown under the radar for the past 12 – 18 months. On macro-economic terms, Hungary’s economy is supported by cheap energy, low interest rates and relatively low exposure to the slowdown in China (a GDP growth of 2.9% in 2015). Looking at it from a property market perspective, strong household consumption will impact retail markets (already tenant turnovers have increased in some cases by double digit figures), buoyant automotive production benefits industrial properties and the expansion of ICT services will further dominate the Budapest office scene (office demand was up 51% y-o-y). The overall cautious development market helps capital values to improve further as rental outlook remains positive for owners. Helped by a strong occupational market and more affordable financing, yield levels can compress further from their current high levels, narrowing the gap against other core Central European markets. &#13;

&amp;ldquo;Unlike other CEE markets, Moscow real estate market has almost bottomed out and provides many opportunities to occupiers and investors. In warehouses and offices we saw elevated tenants' activity and take-up volumes 20-30% higher than in 2014, with the major demand drivers being retail sector in warehouses and state companies and organizations in offices. Although retail real estate is in more difficult situation now, we see a lot of opportunities for retailers, as the market provides attractive leasing terms. There is high ongoing investor activity and significant deal pipeline, as it is the right time to invest with the potential of asset value recovery on the back of market correction.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Significant increases in leasing activity recorded in former recovery markets such as Paris, Milan, Madrid and CEE pushed office take-up sharply higher in the last quarter of 2015. At almost 4.5million sq m, the volume of office space transacted for the period is the highest quarterly level attained since 2008. This, coupled with subdued development activity across Europe, means vacancy levels have dropped to a five-year low. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Office rental growth is uneven across the European markets. However, Madrid, Dublin and Stockholm are among the markets currently seeing good upward momentum. Madrid saw demand for office space push rents to almost &amp;euro;27 per sq m per month and take-up to 186, 000 sq m (+85% q-o-q). Stockholm&amp;rsquo;s lack of prime office stock is set to encourage further rental growth in 2016 having reached a new record in 2015 at 5, 200 SEK per sq m per annum.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton, EMEA Head of Occupier Research, at CORE.XP commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;A new record was set in 2015 as EMEA office take-up levels surpassed the pre-crisis peak. Driving this, was a 30% quarter-on-quarter uplift at the back end of 2015 led by the former recovery markets. For example, Budapest, spearheaded by its burgeoning TMT sector saw 120,000 sq m of office take-up compared to just 46,000 sq m across the previous quarter.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Looking ahead, the three year forecast indicates that Paris will register the highest completions levels across EMEA at 2.5 mn sq m. Supply growth within the Central London market is also anticipated to remain strong.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

“Office take-up in Moscow was 18% higher in 2015, with the main driving force being the state companies (Avtodor leased 12,000 sq m in Pushkinsky Dom, Rosenergoatom &amp;ndash; 11,000 sq m in Port Plaza, and Transneft purchased Evolution BC (79,000 sq m GLA), and institutions (Moscow Government subsidiaries in OKO BC, the Moscow Region Government structures in Orbita BC, and Deposit Insurance Agency in Mosfilmovsky BC (16,000 sq m GLA)). Overall, 2015 was a year of large deals, there were 12 deals over 10,000 sq m (totaling 306,600 sq m or 35% of the take-up) compared to 6 (80,200 sq m or 11%) and 5 (75,800 sq m or 7%) in 2014 and 2013 respectively. As the market is providing good opportunities for occupiers, companies prefer to improve their leasing terms and find more attractive office space in terms of location, building quality and efficiency of workplace.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2015, London outperformed its European counterparts with 26MW of customer IT power sold during the year. Its Q4 total of 10MW marked the highest quarterly take-up in any European market for two years. Underpinning this trend is ongoing momentum from IT infrastructure firms as they continue to host directly from London, having served the market from Dublin. These companies are responsible for the vast majority of transactions as they continue to dominate the European landscape.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Furthermore, ongoing prospects for London remain strong. Large numbers of enterprise firms can now access cloud services as IT Infrastructure companies have started to provide on-off ramps across data centres in London. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The major markets of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris (FLAP cities) enjoyed an overall healthy year with 62MW of take-up during 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Jay, EMEA Head of Data Centre Solutions, at CORE.XP, explained:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t get away from the impact that the IT Infrastructure firms are having on the European landscape. In simple terms, any market they turn their focus to enjoys success. Today, most substantial new requirements are led by IT infrastructure firms coming out of the US West Coast. In essence, these companies, which are few in number, are single-handedly shaping the European markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“As we move through 2016, the expectation is we’ll see a surge of activity in Q1 and Q2, again driven by infrastructure companies, given the market is now primed for large-scale deals. In addition M&amp;amp;amp;A activity is set to continue with the largest transaction already closing in early 2016 &amp;ndash; Equinix acquiring Telecity. Finally, concerns remain regarding data protection and privacy exacerbated by the European Court of Justice’s recent &amp;lsquo;invalid’ ruling with respect to Safe Harbour. We think this will have a positive impact on demand in the smaller European markets.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department, CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“As a result of increased cost of banking finance, many companies revised their plans of their own data centres completion, and prefer to use outsourcing service providers. As a result, the potential of commercial data centres sector for the Moscow office market remains high: more than 70% of the data centres are located in Moscow Region, logically being closer to those companies that use them.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Moreover, adoption of the federal law №242-FZ, requiring to process and store Russian citizens’ personal data on the territory of Russia, oblige large foreign companies to either have their own data centres in Russia, or to use commercial data centres.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
By the end of 2015 the average vacancy rate has stabilized at 8%, as retailers rotation in high streets has moderated.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest vacancy rate increase during the year has been recorded on Leninskiy Avenue, Pyatnitskaya Street and Noviy Arbat Street. At the same time the vacancy has declined in Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street, in Tverskaya Street and Kutuzovsky Avenue. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Most notably, the number of cafe and restaurants and grocery supermarkets has increased over the past 1.5 years. This was a result of high activity of players that offer unique eating concepts and a steady growth of convenient grocery stores opened by chain and non-chain operators of middle and economy price segments.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The share of such segments as fashion (including accessories) and services has been almost unchanged.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Retail segments in main streets, % of total number of occupied premises&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/8e2/Retailers by leased area eng.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Retail segments in main streets, % of total number of occupied premises&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Retail segments in main streets, % of total number of occupied premises&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;651&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;348&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The demand of new international and federal retailers is still high. For example, in 2015 7 out of 40 new international retailers in Moscow opened their first stores in street retail (Greene King, Rouge Bunny Rouge, Santa Maria Novella, Seiko, Serge Lutens, The Bagel bar, Wok to Walk).&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Commercial terms in street retail have also stabilized largely due to the use of key approaches to optimization of street retail leasing terms and flexibility of landlords. Rental rates in rubles have not significantly changed during the year, but the range of asking rents has widened. In streets where the vacancy rate has been increasing steadily, the decline in rents has reached nearly 20-30% and up to 35-40% in some cases in dollar terms.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asking prime rent in street retail for premises 100-200 sq m, RUB/ sq m/ year&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/04c/Rental rates for 100-200 sq m premices eng.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Asking prime rent in street retail for premises 100-200 sq m, rub./ sq m/ year&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Asking prime rent in street retail for premises 100-200 sq m, rub./ sq m/ year&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;651&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;337&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Key trends of the Moscow street retail market for 2016:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Most likely, in 2016 the average vacancy rate will not reduce significantly due to the stable balance between the growth of public catering, stabilization of fashion segment and segment of grocery supermarkets and further reduction of banks and other segments. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tenants will be interested in high streets largely due to comfortable commercial terms that landlords are ready to provide, such as transition to rental rates denominated in rubles, fix of the exchange rate band, discounts on fixed FX-denominated rates, setting up rental rate with consideration of tenants&amp;rsquo; rental budgets, as well as transition to percentage of turnover.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian chain and non-chain retailers are still interested in street retail. New restaurant concepts and grocery supermarkets of convenient store format will be actively opening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In 2016 French retail chain of coffee shops Ladur&amp;eacute;e plans to open 2-3 new coffee shops as well as Italian chain of supermarkets Eataly plans to open the first supermarket. From 2015 experience, international niche retailers of fashion, cosmetics and accessories will prefer to choose street retail.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In 2016 rental rates in dollar equivalent will continue to decline. Ruble rent will remain at the level of 2015. With the stabilization of economic situation and reduction of vacancy rate, landlords of premises in street retail can become more differentiated in terms of rental rates. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pedestrian streets that recently acquired the status of comfortable public space with high pedestrian flows will still be in high demand from potential tenants. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, director of Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP said: &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;ldquo;2015 has become extremely difficult for the Moscow street retail market. Devaluation of the ruble, international sanctions, withdrawal of bank licenses by the Central Bank have led to lower tenant activity and a lot of existing retail units closure. Most retail chains have revised their development strategy and have optimized the business processes. Vacated premises at favorable terms have been occupied by mass-market players that are popular even during the crisis: fast food, budget cafes and restaurants, mini-markets, alcohol markets, discount stores.&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  “Generally, today most landlords are ready to provide ruble rental rates. In exceptional cases, they fix the exchange rate band and provide good commercial terms for tenants, which are mostly targeting the rent using their total rental budget.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Search for Yield Leads to Increased Interest in CEE &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Germany Takes First Place as Investors&amp;rsquo; Preferred Country &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;London Retains Preferred City Status &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Cannes - Moscow, 16 March 2016 &amp;ndash; Real estate investors across the EMEA region intend to be very active in 2016. According to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s 2016 EMEA Investor Intentions Survey almost half (48%) of all surveyed expect their purchasing activity to be higher than last year, compared with just 15% who expect to be less active buyers. 43% also expect their selling activity to increase, indicating a buoyant and liquid real estate investment market for the region in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Despite this commitment to real estate investment, one notable change has been a decline in investors’ appetite for risk. After three years of diminishing popularity, prime or core assets are back on the agenda. The proportion of investors who see prime or core assets as the most attractive part of the market has jumped from 29% last year to 41% in 2016. This is partly explained by investors’ concerns over economic issues. When asked the question &amp;ldquo;What poses the greatest threat to property markets in 2016&amp;rdquo;, global economic weakness was seen as the greatest threat (31%), with domestic economic problems (14%) a distant second. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Diverging investor views were prevalent in the responses given for the most attractive country for real estate investment. Germany was the most frequent choice as investors’ preferred destination, with 17% of all responses. The UK was in close second place with 15.1%, followed by Spain (10.2%), Netherlands (9.9%), France (9.2%) and Poland (9.2%). More importantly however, is the fact that this was by far the closest result of any of CORE.XP’s seven surveys, with many more markets coming into the mix this year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 There was also a big uplift in interest in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). When taken as a group, CEE markets saw their proportion of preference rise from 6% in 2015 to 23% this year. This can partly be explained by investors’ continued “search for yield”. In H2 2015 prime yields in continental Western Europe fell very sharply and this has resulted in the yield gap between CEE and Western Europe increase markedly, raising CEE’s attractiveness to real estate investors. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 At a city level, London retained its preferred status, with 15.1% of all investors favouring the city, but the gap between London and other cities is closing. Madrid came second with 12.2%, closely followed by Paris (11.6%), Berlin (10.8%), Amsterdam (7.3%), Warsaw (7.0%), Milan (4.7%), Budapest (2.9%), Prague (2.7%) and Munich (2.4%). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Across the more traditional sectors, offices remained the favourite asset type with 37% of the responses. However it was residential assets which saw the biggest increase in investor interest, growing from 5% of preferences in 2015 to 12% in 2016. Retail also fared well, and the recovery of consumer confidence and consumer spending has resulted in the proportion of respondents choosing retail increasing from 22% in 2015 to 27% in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The search for yield, as mentioned with regard to CEE, was also apparent in respondents’ answers to the “alternative” sector. 56% of all respondents were already invested in one or more alternative sectors, and 57% were actively looking in one or more of these sectors. Real estate debt is the segment that currently has the most market penetration with over 30% of investors already having some exposure and 22% actively looking for further investment. Student Housing was the segment which attracted the most new interest. 20% of respondents already have investments in this area with most of these seeking further exposure. However there are a further 13% of respondents who are looking to invest in student housing for the first time. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Jonathan Hull, managing director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “There were a few stand-out themes in our survey this year, but the most interesting, to my mind, is investors’ purchasing activity. Almost 85% of respondents expect their purchasing activity in 2016 to remain higher or the same as last year. This result, taken alongside similar figures for investors’ selling intentions, indicates that we are set for another year of strong investment activity. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Overall however, there was much less agreement amongst respondents on what constitutes the most attractive market and preferred investment strategy. As differences in opinion are what make a market, this would suggest that 2016 will be an interesting time in real estate across the EMEA region.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Being at the bottom, Russia is attractive for investors today, and this is supported by the results of the survey, which recorded one of the biggest share increase of respondents who preferred Russian market, its share went up to 2.8% in 2016 from 0.7% in 2015. Russian market after significant correction of capital values offers good investment opportunities, and the main driver for investors now is the potential of asset value recovery. According to the survey, capital value recovery held the second position among the factors motivating for real estate investments, 35% of respondents have chosen this factor”. &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Uncertain retailers&amp;rsquo; demand, as well as expensive and unavailable financing, were the major reasons for lower developers’ activity in Russia. As a result, completions in 2016 could be the record low for the last 10 years. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Completions of modern retail space in 2015 amounted to 1.9 mln. sq. m, which is 13% lower than in 2014. In 2016 in Russia retail premises delivery will be almost 30% lower than in 2015, which is driven by the reduction of new supply in regional cities.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Russia only half of TOP-10 most saturated markets are cities with 1 million inhabitants. The most promising cities for development of retail space are Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Naberezhnye Chelny, Kirov and Chita.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite some negative macroeconomic factors, international retailers are still interested in the Russian regional retail property market, mostly due to lower competition than in Moscow along with sufficiently high purchasing power and favorable leasing terms. 13 out of 53 international brands that came to Russia in 2015 opened their first stores in regional cities.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Key trends of the Russian retail property market for 2016:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers in Russia announced over 2 mln. sq. m of new construction for 2016. According to our estimates, taking into account the current stages of development and terms of delivery of every project, the actual delivery in 2016 will be about 1.3 mln. sq. m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;bull;	Current interest rates and continued decline in the Russian economy are not conducive to the start of construction of new projects. Construction of shopping centres at the final stages with guaranteed financing, with high probability will be finished during 2016-2017. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The interest of developers and retailers to large cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg, cities with population above 1 mln. inhabitants) will stay, mostly due to high purchasing power in these markets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shopping centres in the cities with high penetration rate (e.g., Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar, Tyumen, Yaroslavl) need reconception. Even relatively low cost changes can increase consumers’ loyalty and increase shopping centres’ attendance.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Major retail chains of &amp;laquo;middle&amp;raquo; and «economy» price segments will continue regional expansion: in 2016 further expansion announced such key market players as OBI, Leroy Merlin, Decathlon, H&amp;amp;amp;M, McDonald`s, KFC, Subway, Nathan`s Famous.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In order to keep stable position on the market, other retail chains will continue reducing the number of unprofitable retail outlets in regions, that will result in further increase in vacancy rates in some markets, and increase the time period required for new shopping centres to be populated with tenants. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Michael Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail department CORE.XP in Russia, comments: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Retailers in regions are more carefully selecting and evaluating locations for opening their new shopping centres. With high probability, key trend of business optimization and reduction of unprofitable shopping centres in regions will continue in 2016. However, this will be compensated by high activity of major international and federal retail chains as well as retailers of &amp;lsquo;middle’ and ‘economy’ price segments, that traditionally rent premises in shopping centres as anchor tenants.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Developers have announced over 3.2 mln. sq. m of new construction for 2016-2017 in Russia (including Moscow and Saint-Petersburg), which is about 15% of current total stock. However, taking into account current credit conditions, not all the announced projects will be completed in time. According to our estimates, only 60% of new supply will be delivered in 2016-2017, construction of other projects will be postponed, and projects will be completed not earlier than 2018-2019&amp;rdquo;.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 For the whole year, total new delivery of I&amp;amp;amp;L space in the Russian regions amounted to 683,000 sq m, which is 16.8% higher than in 2014. This result represents all-time record for regional markets – previous maximum was seen in 2009 (673,000 sq m). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Significant trends for I&amp;amp;amp;L market in the Russian regions in H2 2015 include: &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In the second half of 2015, total new delivery in regional centres (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg) amounted to 449,000 sq m, which is almost two times higher than in the first half of the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Occupiers&amp;rsquo; activity significantly increased in Q3-Q4 2015 – total take-up jumped to 223,000 sq m, which is 4.6 higher than in H1.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy rate stays at 9% level, while the amount of vacant premises has slightly increased.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average rental rates remain constant and stay at the level of RUB4,500 per sq m per annum for class A properties and RUB3,500 – for class B.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Demand&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Total take-up in the regions in 2015 stood at 271,000 sq m, which is 10.5% lower than in 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Nevertheless, market activity in regions is still high and comparable to results of two previous years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Demand is mainly fuelled by food retail. Despite slight decrease of this sector activity (-3% of take-up compared to 2014), its share in total take-up reached 63%. More than a half of taken-up premises relates to this sector for the second year in a row. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The major demand driving force was federal retail chains, which use current economic environment as an opportunity for expansion of their business. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Production sector showed good performance as well and took 2.8 times more premises than in 2014. The reason of its growing activity was number of deals with involvement of food industry companies and alcohol producers – 54% of production sector take-up. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The largest deals of 2015 were completed with X5 Retail Group in Krasnodar, Kaluga and Perm (47,000 sq m, 38,665 sq m and 26,367 sq m accordingly). Leroy Merlin leased 19,856 sq m in Samara in nonfood sector. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Demand volume is expected to be moderate in the coming years, and the need for new warehouse space will depend on retail chains expansion plans more than it was before. &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take-up structure in 2015 was very similar to previous years – lease transactions (89% of all deals) overwhelmed purchases (11%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;New delivery&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 New supply is expected to decline in 2016 through shrinkage of speculative development. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 375,000 sq m of warehouse premises on regional markets is already under construction. All-in-all 2016 completions may reach 400,000 sq m. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The majority of regional markets are facing quite high vacancy rates. Thus, developers are likely to focus on letting vacant premises in existing buildings or on build-to-suit projects. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 55% of projects built in 2015 relates to Top-10 regional markets, including Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Samara, Rostov-on-Don, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kazan, Voronezh, Tula, Chelyabinsk and Krasnodar. Almost the same proportion was seen in 2014 – 53% of total completions. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Highest delivery was seen in Yekaterinburg, where new supply increased by 4 times as compared to 2014, and reached 98,000 sq m. As a result, Yekaterinburg became the largest regional market in terms of modern logistic premises, slightly ahead of Novosibirsk (764,000 sq m vs 757,000 sq m). &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Vacancy rates in the Russian Regions in the relatively developed markets amounted to 4-8% of the total stock. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Commercial terms&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Average rent for class A and B warehouses stays at mid-2015 level of RUB4,300 per sq m per annum, including OPEX and VAT. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Average asking rental rate: &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;for class A properties – RUB4,700 per sq m per year, including OPEX and VAT&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;for class B properties – RUB3,500 per sq m per year, including OPEX and VAT&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 Vasiliy Grigoriev, Senior Consultant, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;In 2015 regional markets saw the record-breaking supply volumes. However, we cannot say that regions were oversupplied with such huge delivery pipeline – 80% of commissioned space is already occupied by end-users. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “In coming years need for new warehouse space on regional markets will persist at current level entailed by food retailers activity. We expect new supply will come to markets, in most cases, through build-to-suit projects intended for specific companies, in particular for retail chains.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Anton Alyabyev, Director of I&amp;amp;amp;L Department of CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Largest food retailers such as X5, Magnit, Lenta and others are the key consumers of warehouse space in the regions. These companies increase their activity in the regional markets and expand their logistic infrastructure alongside with new store openings. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “In 2016 this tendency to preserve. Even now almost half a million of new distribution centers of federal retail chains is being constructed.” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This mixed-use complex consists of three parts: residential for 3,000 people, Class B+ business centre with the total area of 10,000 sq. m and shopping and entertainment centre with the total area of 32,000 sq. m (20,000 sq. m GLA), including parking for 1,000 cars. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mikhail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;ldquo;We are happy that the lease agreements are signed with these companies.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Saratov has been the only city with a million population where this retail group is not present. The company always expects high standards in the properties and location of the projects it chooses. Partially the reason for not being present in Saratov lays in the lack of vacant quality retail properties.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The first Bershka will be opened in Triumph Mall.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of the shopping centre is 58,000 sq m. It was opened in 2010 and there are no vacant premises left. The developer of the project is MirLand Development Corporation. There are 13 residential and commercial properties in the developer&amp;rsquo;s portfolio. The total area of all the projects is 1.3 mln. sq m. Among the major projects are residential Triumph Park in Saint-Petersburg, MirLand business-centre in Moscow and Triumph Mall in Saratov as well as Yaroslavskiy Vernisazh in Yaroslavl.&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 20 April 2016 &amp;ndash; CORE.XP, global real estate advisor, summarized Q1 2016 results in Moscow Retail Market. According to the report by the end of Q1 2016 average vacancy rate declined by 0.2 ppts and reached 9.2%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Vacancy rate reduction was recorded in new projects, to 18.4% from 21.2%. At the same time, this indicator increased in shopping centers delivered earlier than 2014, to 7.1% from 6.4%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 2016 no new shopping center has been delivered in Moscow. Until the end of 2016 at least 6 shopping centers with high stage of readiness are expected to be opened: Okeania (ex- Gallery Kutuzovskiy, 60,000 sq m), Khorosho (52,000 sq m), Butovo Mall (57,000 sq m), Riga Mall (80,000 sq m), and the 2nd phase of Fashion House Outlet (4,500 sq m). Riviera (100,000 sq m rentable area) was opened in Moscow on 15 April 2016.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Taking into the account the number of new shopping centres to be delivered in Moscow Region in 2016 by the end of 2016 the average vacancy rate in Moscow shopping malls may increase to 11%, as the new projects is expected to open with 40-60% vacancy rate.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime rental rate in Moscow shopping centres in Q1 2016 remains at $ 1,650/ sq m/ pa.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Q1 2016 the retailer activity remained at the level of H2 2015. 8 new international brands opened their first store in Moscow in Q1 2016. In addition, 6 new international retailers announced their plans to enter the market during 2016: Walt Disney, Newby London, Lillapois, NYX, Hunkem&amp;ouml;ller и Undiz.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Among foreign brands, Stockmann announced in Q1 their plans to close their Lindex stores. A year earlier, Stockmann did the same with its Sepp&amp;auml;lä brand in Russia, as well as sold its retail business to Debenhams.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;New shopping centers are now offering very favorable commercial terms for new outlets opening. That was the reason for the vacancy rate decline in new shopping centers (to 18.4% in Q1 2016 from 22.1% at the end of 2015), which usually are represented by modern design and concept, better thought out floor plans, enough parking slots. The main factors forming the rental payment in the shopping center under construction are its stage of construction and occupancy rate, the concept quality and its positioning, which are directly effecting the retailer turnover.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Expectations are that for the entire year, investment volumes will reach and exceed the record volumes of 2015, with all CEE countries expected to perform strongly. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The quarter was dominated by a multitude of small and medium size transactions, for all core real-estate sectors. The average transaction price in Q1 2015 was over €45 mln in across less than 50 transactions within the region. This is compared to Q1 2016, where the average transaction price was €24 mln, from more than 110 closed transactions. While trophy assets are still on the radar for a number of investors, smaller, but attractive products are on the investors&amp;rsquo; purchasing list, more so, if part of a regional portfolio. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Compared to full 2015, when US investors accounted for 30% of investment into the region, at the start of the year those most active in the first quarter have been German investors, followed by local/ regional investors (Polish, Czech or Slovak investors). South African funds have restated their interest for the region with record breaking transactions in Serbia and Montenegro, with more investments expected in other CEE countries over the course of the year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Throughout the region prime yields have mostly remained stable compared to Q4 2015, with two major exceptions: Czech Republic and Poland, where compression of 25 bps was recorded for office sector which is now priced at 5.50%; a record low level for this current economic cycle. This comes on the back of high levels of interest from investors for core assets, of which there is a shortage of available product. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Russia registered a stellar q-o-q increase, with Q1 volumes reaching almost 60% of full 2015 volumes. The main driver for investors interested in Russia now is the potential of asset value recovery on the back of the market correction. Despite the uncertainty in the market, investors see the benefits of investing at market bottom and the advantage over other investment opportunities in the form of value retention in the long term. Taking into account the volume of deals in Q1 2016 and current deals under negotiations, we upgraded our forecasts to €4bn from previous €2.5bn.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andreas Ridder, Chairman CEE, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;2016 is expected to be a record year for the entire CEE region, with Hungary, Slovakia and Romania catching up and becoming stars of the region. No doubt, interest for core-CEE markets, Czech Republic and Poland, will remain very strong and new records might be established in 2016. Already investment activity picked up in Serbia, the Baltics and Bulgaria, a trend set to continue throughout the year. In some markets or sectors, investors will face scarcity of attractive products, available for transaction.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The Q1 2016 investment volumes in Russia were the result of pending demand realization start. The closure of two large deals has made significant contribution to the total investment volume. The volume of deals estimated to be closed this year amounted to about $2 bn (€1.75 bn) that allows us to expect the investment volume of about $4.5 bn (€3.9 bn). It will be supported by the stabilization and appreciation of ruble on the back of increasing oil prices, expectations of key rate cut on the back of inflation ease, Asian and Middle Eastern investors’ activity, as well as market bottom that offers good investment opportunities.”&#13;

 PODIUM market opened its first regional stores in Krasnodar and Kazan, which are the cities with the population of over 1 mln. people. Third regional department store the company will open in Surgut, a city with a population of 350 000 people. PODIUM market in Surgut will be the most distant company&amp;rsquo;s store in the eastern part of Russia, which might suggest further expansion of the retailer. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Taking into account strong competition between the shopping malls in Surgut, signing of the contract with PODIUM market for SEC Surgut City Mall confirms high professionalism of the team. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Surgut City Mall originally had unique tenant mix: Entertainment Park Happylon, cinema Cinemapark with IMAX and 4DX, DIY OBI. These tenants as well we many others opened their one and only stores in the region in Surgut City Mall. Opening of Podium market once again confirms the high status of the project and becomes long-awaited event for the customers. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report, measuring shopping centre development in 168 major cities, highlights that China remains the most active market in term of delivery of news space, accounting for two thirds of construction globally. Cities such as Chongqing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai all have over 3 million sq m of space under construction in over 30 projects in each city. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Emerging markets such as Manila, Moscow, Mexico City and Bangalore remain highly active, however activity in the emerging Eastern European markets such as Russia have slowed due to economic and political uncertainty.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Across the board, global shopping centre completions have started to slow as parts of the global retail market experiences an imbalance between significant supply and demand. Globally 10.7 million sq m of new space opened in 2015, down from 12.1 million sq m in 2014. Development activity in Europe continues to be slow in comparison to Asia – only a quarter of cities surveyed in EMEA saw the completion of a new centre last year, and the levels of completions slowed down from 2.6 million to 1.6 million. EMEA accounted for 15% of total completions globally in 2015 with the vast majority of space being built in Russian cities.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Moscow is once again the only market outside of Asia that appears in the top 10 of global shopping centre completions. In 2015, 404,392 sq m of space in seven centres completed in Moscow. Amongst the schemes completed, Columbus (135,000 sq m GLA) and Kuntsevo Plaza (68,000 sq m GLA) opened in 2015. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that 2014 and 2015 are set to be the most active years for the Russia pipeline and securing finance in 2016 will be a challenge. As a result the pipeline is expected to slow going forward. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Middle Eastern retail market remains an attractive proposition for international retailers. As such, the UAE’s development pipeline is significant with a number of major centres set for delivery over the next three years. This includes Nakheel’s Palm Mall in Dubai which compromises around 111,000 sq m of GLA and is expected to complete in 2018, and The Point which has a total GLA of 48,000 sq m and is due to open in 2017. Doha is witnessing a transformation of its retail sector amidst an ongoing construction boom which could see around 1.2 million sq m GLA delivered over the next three years alone in advance of the Qatar World Cup 2022.&#13;

Natasha Patel, Director, EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo; Shopping centre development remains active across Asia, however the notable change this year is the slowing in the number of completions, in many cases in markets where there are high levels of construction already and weakening demand, landlords are becoming exposed to oversupply. Now landlord’s operational expertise will come to the fore as they attempt to enhance footfall through experiential retailing, food and beverage and leisure.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“In Western Europe and the US, a lack of quality space continues to be an issue. Extensions, refurbishments and repositions of existing assets continue to be the focus in Western Europe in a bid to continue to attract key brands and consumers alike. Access to good quality space will also remain a challenge in many markets and will prompt retailers to consider alternative retail formats with high foot traffic such as transport hubs.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Completions volume in Moscow will decline significantly from 2016 onwards. This is driven by unavailable and expensive financing and relatively low retailer demand on the back of declined consumer purchasing power. We expect 6 shopping centres of 350,000 sq m GLA to be completed this year. New shopping centres launching with occupancy ratio of 30-40% on average, so increase the market vacancy rate significantly. Lowered completion volume will positively affect the market, we expect the vacancy rate to decline to 7-8% by the end of 2017 from 11% expected in 2016.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of this warehouse complex is 100,000 sq m. The total area of the land plot is 35 hectares.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Agency Services team was the consultant in this deal.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Belligen leased the whole warehouse building as well as a large plot of 2 hectares for heavy vehicles.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This warehouse complex is located in 18 km from MKAD and in close proximity to Egorovskoye, Ryazanskoye and Novoryazanskoye highways.

With investment levels significantly above the ten year average of €43 billion, Q1 2016 was the third best first quarter on record, surpassed only twice before, in 2007 and 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and Russia all had strong first quarters. Finland had its best quarter since Q1 2008 with €1.8 billion invested, a 214% uplift compared to Q1 2015. The Netherlands recorded €2.1 billion of investment, a 75% increase compared to the same quarter in 2015, and Portugal and Belgium also saw strong levels of investment with year-on-year increases of 158% and 31% respectively. In Russia, following a quiet couple of years, the market picked up and Q1 2016 investment volumes grew by 177% year-on-year, driven largely by domestic buyers attracted by keen pricing and rents which appear to have bottomed out. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A number of factors, including equity market volatility and lack of available prime assets helped to slightly mute investment into French and German markets as well as the UK, which has contended with Brexit uncertainty.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a sector level, industrial property attracted €5.8 billion of investment, its best first quarter on record, up 57% on Q1 2015. Compared to other sectors, investment into industrial assets in Q1 made up 11.5% of the total investment into European commercial real estate. This is almost double (6%) when compared to the same quarter in 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, managing director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;European commercial real estate continues to attract strong levels of interest, despite macro-economic uncertainty in some markets, and there is a significant weight of capital, both domestic and international, still looking to enter the market. The prevailing trend is slightly less opportunistic than we have seen in previous quarters and demand is very much focused around quality income and core assets.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Russian commercial real estate is interesting for investments because of corrected values, which are either approaching, or have already reached the bottom. The most active are Russian investors, while western capital is still here and is looking for attractive assets to purchase. Moreover some Asian and Middle Eastern investors created local teams and are actively considering opportunities offered by the market. They are most of all interested in centrally located stabilised income producing assets.”</value></field><field name="DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="CODE"><value>emea_investment_q1_2016</value></field><field name="TAGS"/><field name="XML_ID"><value>1614</value></field><field name="IBLOCK_SECTION"/><property name="P_DIR"><value>728</value></property><property name="P_COUNTRY"><value>419</value><value>418</value></property><property name="P_FILE"/></item><item><field name="ACTIVE"><value>Y</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_FROM"><value>24.05.2016 16:35:00</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_TO"/><field name="SORT"><value>500</value></field><field name="NAME"><value>Moscow Attracted 40 New Retailers in 2015, the Highest Number Seen in Europe</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_PICTURE"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT"><value>&#13;

 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 24 May 2016 – Cities across Europe, the Middle East and Africa dominate half of the top 10 global markets occupied by international retailers with London retaining its number one spot in the rankings, reports CORE.XP in the ninth edition of its &amp;lsquo;How Global is the Business of Retail?&amp;rsquo;. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The 2016 rankings show that 57.9% of international retailers are present in London. Dubai is hot on the heels of the London with 57%, closely followed by Shanghai (54.4%), New York (46.6%) and Singapore and Moscow joint 5th (46%) making up the remainder of the top five. Hong Kong (45%) is 7th followed by Paris (44.3%) in 8th, Tokyo in 9th (43.4%) and Beijing and Berlin in joint 10th place with 42.7%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Overall, new cross border retail activity grew modestly in 2015 with the number of new entrants at city level up by 3.1%. Retailers focussed on a diverse set of markets in the same time period with 90% of the surveyed cities seeing at least one new entrant in 2015 (compared with 85% in 2014 based on a like for like basis) and 30% of the markets surveyed saw at least 10 new brands open a store.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London and the UK retain the number one position for having the highest number of international retailers present. London also became the second most desirable city in Europe for new retailers with a total of 39 brands entering the city with over half of all new entrants originating from either France or the US. New entrants also included a large majority from the Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage sector.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hugh Radford, Chairman - London Retail, CORE.XP comments: &amp;ldquo;Despite the perceived high rental levels and fierce competition for limited space, the UK and indeed London remain key global destinations for retailers looking to expand their store networks. In recent years we have seen other cities, such as Dubai and Shanghai, close the gap on London, but with 39 brands launching stores in 2015 alone, it continues to be the most penetrated city for international retailers looking to develop their portfolios. It’s clear that the UK’s capital remains a magnet for brands looking to announce their arrival on the international scene.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Dubai is the second most popular market for retailers globally with 57% of international brands present. The city also attracted 38 new retailers to their market in 2015, with the majority of new brands originating from Europe and the US, with a lesser number from Asia and the Middle East. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nicholas Maclean, Managing Director, CORE.XP Middle East Region, “Due to the economic situation in many home markets, retailers are continuing to look for alternative locations in order to drive future expansion capacity and Dubai continues to offer retailers a viable option to more mature markets without some of the risk normal associated with an emerging market.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Dubai’s Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage (F&amp;amp;amp;B) market has been a key focus in recent years and continues to attract significant interest from both international and home grown restaurant brands with Din Tai Fung and Five Guys being some of the latest names to open the doors to the public. The outlook for F&amp;amp;amp;B remains positive and continues to see significant spending on socialising and eating out generated by UAE nationals as well as expatriates.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In terms of new entrants, Moscow attracted 40 new retailers in 2015, the highest number seen in Europe and fifth sought after market globally. Despite the country’s tense geo-political and economic situation, tenants have started to see more favourable terms compared those agreed pre-crisis. A large proportion of existing retailers were able to change the principle of rent mechanism from fixed rent to turnover related. The opening of retail schemes provided fresh location options and strong incentives for new retail players; despite weakened consumer demand.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Despite the economic turbulence, Russian market offers very favourable leasing terms and consumers who are hungry for all types of goods. Historically rental rates in Moscow were high, and the best locations were always available after queuing in waiting list. That is why retailers now see current conditions as window of opportunity to open a store in a good location at the best price, which could close in 12-18 months, as the shopping centre development pipeline is drying up and new projects, not yet planned, will be realised not earlier than in 3-to-5 yeas.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Madrid entered the top target markets for the first time in 2015 with 23 new entrants. Many retailers put their expansion plans for Spain on hold during the economic crisis and this alone has created opportunities for other brands who have taken advantage of the attractive rents and prime high street space, where availability is usually scarce. This demand has led to the historical high street retail areas being extended in Madrid and Barcelona. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At a global level Hong Kong is now the top retail market for new entrants in 2015 attracting 73 new brands, up from 58 in 2014. Singapore follows a close second attracting 63 new brands, only slightly higher compared to last year, and last year’s top market, Tokyo, slid to third place after a slowdown in domestic demand.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Expansion into North America increased significantly in 2015 up from 3% to 13%. Strong upward trends in consumer indicators such as employment and job growth prospects may be attracting retailers who are looking at the longer-term growth prospects in the region. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Canada, Toronto saw 26 new entrants as retail sales grew 3.2% in 2015. The city is forecast to grow another 4.5% in 2016 largely due to the cosmopolitan nature of the city with its large and diverse population.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Natasha Patel, Director, EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP commented: “Cross-border retailer activity grew modestly in 2015 with the number of new entrants at city level is up by 3.1%. Hong Kong took the top spot for “hottest retail market” from Tokyo. Although the slowdown in retail sales and tourist spending has prompted some retailers to rationalise their store network or withdraw from the market, the sharp rental corrections in major streets in Hong Kong have created significant opportunity for expanding brands in a market which may otherwise have been out of reach. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“However as economic climates in the East start to experience oncoming headwinds, retailers will continue to look to new markets to expand their store networks and capitalise on prevailing economies, particularly in the West and more emerging markets such as those in Africa and Latin America.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Globally, Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage retailers accounted for 20% of new entrants overall, followed by Luxury &amp;amp;amp; Business Fashion (19%), Mid-Range Fashion (18%) and Specialist Clothing (17%) retailers. In 2015, Asia Pacific expanded its Coffee &amp;amp;amp; Restaurant offering by 33%, EMEA 14% and Americas 12%, with all regions looking to diversify their tenant mix.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mark Burlton, Global Executive, Retail Occupier team, EMEA commented: “With investment in to online platforms increasing, more scrutiny will be placed on store portfolios, ensuring that retailers have the right mix of locations. These ‘locations’ must incorporate a good omnichannel environment for consumers to engage with. Where space restrictions are becoming an issue, retailers are looking to target alternative retail formats such as travel hubs to grow their store networks as more emphasis will be placed on having the right mix of locations in a store portfolio. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Shopping centres will play an important role in creating opportunities for new entrant expansion with owners having to reposition the assets so that consumers are offered a more comprehensive, leisure, lifestyle and Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage concepts as well as diversifying their traditional retail mix. Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage brands will play an increasingly important role in creating shopping destinations in the future as consumers look for location capable of meeting all requirements.

Marina Malakhatko, Director, Moscow Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s such an honor for us to represent this well-known European brand in the Russian market. It is the right time for the brands which are represented in multiband stores to enter the market as monobrands, because landlords of shopping centres demonstrate flexibility towards tenants, and are ready to fix good commercial terms in rubles. Also, most of them are ready to partially compensate fit-out costs.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Steve Swerdlow, CEO CORE.XP Asia Pacific, said &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“CORE.XP | WTW, alongside our existing occupier outsourcing business in Malaysia, will provide a deep, broad platform that provides clients with access to a comprehensive suite of market-leading real estate services. CORE.XP | WTW creates powerful advantages for clients of both firms, combining WTW’s valuation, agency and capital markets expertise with CORE.XP’s full service offering.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP’s occupier outsourcing business - called Global Workplace Solutions - serves a blue-chip list of occupiers across a wide range of industries, particularly financial services, healthcare, industrial/manufacturing, life sciences, technology and telecommunications. CORE.XP manages a market-leading 5.2 billion square feet of commercial property and corporate facilities across the globe. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mohd Talhar Abdul Rahman, Non-Executive Chairman, C H Williams Talhar &amp;amp;amp; Wong said, “WTW’s long-standing success over the last 55 years is a testament to the trust and support of our clients and to the dedication and commitment of our people in serving and fulfilling that trust. We are confident that CORE.XP is the right strategic partner whose scale and reach globally can help our clients expand their activities beyond our shores more fruitfully, and can help bring greater meaningful inbound investment into the Malaysian real estate market.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Malaysia - like the rest of South East Asia - is well positioned to benefit from the well-directed increase in economic and investment activities that are expected from the liberalisation of capital inflows into the Asean Economic Community (AEC). This expectation is based on the region’s prospects for long-range growth potential and its correspondingly higher investment appeal. The Malaysian Economic Transformation Programme (METP), which is expected to generate US$400 billion in investments by 2020, will help to catalyze that growth for Malaysia.&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prime Logistics Rents in Moscow Region Declined Two Times in USD Terms on the Back of Ruble Devaluation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow, 30 May 2016 &amp;ndash; Prime logistics rents in hub markets increased 2.8 percent year-over-year amid strong demand from supply chain users seeking modern distribution facilities to accommodate growing global trade and e-commerce activity, according to CORE.XP Group, Inc.&amp;rsquo;s inaugural Global Prime Logistics Rents report.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Global consumer demand is strong, and an ever-increasing share of retail sales are taking place online, which is prompting traditional retailers, e-commerce companies and third-party logistics firms to seek out advanced &amp;lsquo;prime’ logistics warehouses to modernize their supply chains to facilitate the rapid delivery of goods,&amp;rdquo; said Richard Barkham, CORE.XP’s global chief economist.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong topped the list of “most expensive” markets worldwide, with prime logistics rents of US$28.94 per sq. ft. per annum, followed by Tokyo (US$16.74 per sq. ft.) and London (US$16.36 per sq. ft.). The top market in the Americas was Los Angeles-Orange County, ranked 12th globally at US$8.04 per sq. ft.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Land-constrained markets command a significant rent premium,” noted David Egan, head of industrial and logistics research in the Americas for CORE.XP. “Markets where land is more plentiful, most notably major U.S. hubs like Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, are more affordable.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Regionally, prime logistics rents were up 5.6 percent year-over-year in the Americas, 2.5 percent in Asia Pacific and 0.8 percent in EMEA. Eight of the 10 fastest-growing markets were in the Americas, led by Oakland (up 29.8 percent year-over-year), New Jersey (up 15.0 percent year-over-year), and the Inland Empire (up 13.5 percent year-over-year).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP tracks prime rents&amp;mdash;the highest achievable rents for the logistics facility of the highest quality and specification—in 68 logistics hubs around the world. Fifty-nine percent (40 markets) of tracked markets saw year-over-year increases in rents, 25 percent (17 markets) saw no change and only 16 percent (11 markets) saw decreases.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
The sharp rise in prime rents in the Americas was largely due to massive growth in U.S. coastal markets, where relentless occupier demand drove up pricing. In Oakland, desire for quality premises is the dominant factor for inner-bay logistics users despite the high cost. New development in some markets, such as the Inland Empire, is commanding premium rates. In Latin America, Santiago and Ciudad Juarez notched increases in prime rent of 10.9 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively. In S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, prime rents were down 10.5 percent year-over-year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the slowdown in China’s economy, 15 out of the 27 markets tracked in Asia Pacific experienced rent growth. Third-party logistics firms and retailers are taking a longer-term view and continue to upgrade their distribution networks. Seoul recorded 6.5 percent annual growth in prime rents as supportive government policies, rapid e-commerce growth and the modernization of the logistics industry continues in South Korea. The small, open economies of Hong Kong and Singapore showed some weakness in rents as regional trade slowed, though they remain among the most expensive industrial markets worldwide.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;EMEA&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
European markets saw more marginal gains overall, with several hubs experiencing no growth at all. The U.K. Midlands, London and Berlin saw the strongest growth, with an average of 7.9 percent year-over-year growth in prime industrial rents. These areas are seeing increased demand from e-commerce-related users as more Europeans shop online. On the other end of the spectrum, Moscow had the deepest decline, showing a 45.8 percent drop in prime industrial rents (measured in U.S. dollars) due to declining oil prices that have led to recessionary conditions.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Strategic Analysis and Planning Department CORE.XP in Russia: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Prime logistics rents in Moscow Region declined two times in USD terms on the back of ruble devaluation. After the correction the market now offers attractive price levels for buying logistics, both to investors and end-users. It is now more efficient to purchase existing facility, or built-to-suit in the existing logistic parks, rather than constructing by themselves. Current pricing attracted new buyers on the market, both investors (Mubadala bought two large warehouse complex of about 200,000 sq m) and end-users, mostly large retailers. Sale price has approached the cost of construction, and the abilities for cost optimization are almost over even for systemic developers. Inflation and imported construction materials will stimulate the growth of construction costs. In its turn it will result in increase of sale prices, thus closing the current window of opportunities.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The realization of this scenario depends on macroeconomic improvements, and the change of the demand structure from relocations to the expansion phase. It will also be positively affected by the decline of non-contracted speculative completions to a minimum, which will offset competition between developers and constrain downward pressure on rents.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
700,000-800,000 sq m of the new warehouse space is expected to be built in 2016, which is comparable to the results of 2015. Growing construction costs fueled by inflation, and accompanied by low rental rate levels may result in a further decrease of developers&amp;rsquo; activity in 2017, mainly through shrinkage of speculative schemes and projects of the second tier developers. The share of speculative development may decline to 38% in 2016 compared to 71% in 2015. This indicator was much higher during the pre-crisis period in 2013-2014, and amounted to 75% on average. In addition, the end of the relocations wave expected to happen in 2017 may become a further prerequisite for shifting away from the speculative development. As a result, annual completions level in 2017 may decrease to 500,000-600,000 sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Along with the fall of the ruble, the average level of USD-denominated rents in 2014-2016 has declined to $77 versus $125 in 2007-2013, and stimulates current demand: a significant part of deals is relocation with more favorable commercial terms. Relocations to new warehouses led to vacation of the secondary market space, while expansion and growth on the market are demonstrated only by large retail chains. As a result, the market is facing low absorption levels.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Further development of the situation depends on the dynamics of economic indicators. The improvement of the economic environment will strengthen demand in 2017 and create prerequisites for return to the pre-crisis pace of the market growth (500,000-700,000 sq m of net absorption). As a result, the rental rate in warehouse segment in the Moscow Region will return to the end of 2014 mark.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabyev, Director, Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Agency Services, CORE.XP said: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Commercial terms in the market are still comfortable for occupiers. At the moment we see high business activity from them – a large number of deals is being closed, and many companies have already taken the opportunity to move to a new warehouse at an attractive price.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Aside from relocations, the large market players, in particular retail chains, are acting intensively in the market letting large warehouse complexes. Next year we expect increase of the number of such deals and the demand strengthening in the market as a whole.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Vasiliy Grigoriev, Senior Consultant of Industrial Research CORE.XP in Russia comments:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“High vacancy rate and as a consequence high level of competition in the market are keeping rents from growth. At the same time developers have already reduced supply volumes significantly and new projects are being launched provided that preliminary contract is signed by client.”&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“We courted some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest funds and leading investors for this exercise and without exception, all of them were in agreement that Asia Square is a premium office asset; the building quality and superior location in the expanding Marina Bay are indisputable. Marina Bay is Singapore’s equivalent to London’s Canary Wharf or Shanghai’s Liujiazui. The buyer and seller can walk away from this deal smiling as both have achieved excellent outcomes”.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Singapore and Moscow share an appetite from Middle Eastern investors. Qatar Investment Authorities acquired an investment property in Moscow in 2014 and just closed a deal in Singapore. Moscow office income producing business centers, just like in Singapore, are also on the radar of investors, not only of Middle Eastern but also of Asian and western origin. The sale of White Square in 2012 and Evolution Tower in 2016 are among billion-worth office deals in Moscow. Investors are currently seeking opportunities of high quality and corrected pricing, reflecting current market situation. At the same time, those opportunities are difficult to capture and realize: investment product is limited in Moscow, and landlord pricing expectation is holding up with the anticipation of market recovery. Nevertheless, we expect an increase in market activity in H2 2016, resulting in a total 2016 investment volume in commercial real estate of approximately US$4.5 bn USD.”&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow, &amp;mdash; June 17, 2016 — Hong Kong has become the world&amp;rsquo;s highest-priced office market and Asia continued to top the list of the world’s most expensive office locations, accounting for four of the top five markets, according to CORE.XP Research’s latest semi-annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs survey. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong’s (Central) overall prime occupancy costs of US$290 per sq. ft. per year topped the &amp;ldquo;most expensive&amp;rdquo; list, displacing London’s West End (US$262 per sq. ft.). Beijing (Finance Street) (US$188 per sq. ft.), Beijing (Central Business District (CBD)) (US$182 per sq. ft.) and Hong Kong (West Kowloon) (US$179 per sq. ft.) rounded out the top five. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The study also found that the real estate recovery in Ireland continued to gain momentum, with Dublin, which experienced a 50 percent drop in rents during the downturn, showing the second-largest year-over-year prime occupancy cost increase among the 126 cities surveyed (up 16.6 percent year-over-year)—second only to Hong Kong West Kowloon (up 19.5 percent year-over-year). In North America, real estate fundamentals saw steady improvement with both Atlanta (Downtown) and Seattle (Downtown) among the 10 markets with the fastest growing prime occupancy costs. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Global prime office occupancy costs—which reflect rent, plus local taxes and service charges for the highest-quality, “prime” office properties—rose 2.4 percent year-over-year, with the Americas up 2.3 percent, EMEA up 2.1 percent and Asia Pacific up 2.7 percent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“We expect the global economy to keep growing, and the global service sector, the primary occupier of prime office properties, will continue to expand through periods of volatility, “ said Richard Barkham, global chief economist, CORE.XP. “Since inflation is low, the growth in prime office occupancy costs is significant for both users and investors.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP tracks occupancy costs for prime office space in 126 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 20 were in Asia Pacific, 20 were in EMEA and 10 were in the Americas. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Europe is benefitting from a cyclical pick-up in consumer spending and business investment, as well as a very competitive currency and intense monetary stimulus, which helped to make Dublin, Stockholm and Barcelona the fastest-growing markets in the region. Most Central and Eastern European markets were down year-over-year, including Moscow, which is still in the midst of a recession. Costs accelerated quickly in South Africa, with Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban all seeing increases of at least 6.9 percent from year-ago levels. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Only 11 out of 56 EMEA markets recorded a year-over-year decline in prime office occupancy costs. &#13;

In addition to London West End, the other market from the region in the global top 10 was London City (US$145 per sq. ft.).&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director of Research Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“For the last nine months Moscow ranks 11th in the top 50 world’s most expensive office locations. The most expensive offices in Moscow are located in close proximity to the Kremlin area and Tverskaya Street. Asking rental rates for class A Prime offices reach $1,200 per sq m per year net of operational expenses and VAT. The upper bound of the operational expenses in class A Prime is at $250 per sq m per year. The average rental rate for class A Prime is $ 800-900. This range of rates is the lowest since the crisis of 2008.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
Asia Pacific was home to seven of the top 10 most expensive markets—Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Beijing (CBD), Hong Kong (West Kowloon), Tokyo (Marunouchi/Otemachi), New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD), and Shanghai (Pudong). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The service sector will show particularly strong growth in Asia as pensions and insurance products gain market share. So occupancy cost growth will continue to trend upwards at a moderate pace.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong (Central) is the only market in the world—other than London’s West End—with a prime occupancy cost exceeding US$200 per sq. ft. Hong Kong Central’s double-digit growth in occupancy costs was fuelled by two factors: an ultra-low vacancy rate due to lack of new development and continued demand for high-quality space in prime locations by mainland Chinese companies.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$93 per sq. ft.), in 22nd place. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A few key Southeast Asian markets registered decreases, including Singapore and Jakarta.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
In the Americas, four markets—Monterrey, Atlanta (Downtown), Seattle (Downtown) and Atlanta (Suburban)—recorded double-digit percentage gains year-over-year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New York Midtown, number nine on the global list, remained the most expensive market in the Americas, with a prime office occupancy cost of US$137 per sq. ft. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Several energy-centric markets experienced material drops in occupancy costs, including Calgary (Downtown and Suburban), Houston (Suburban) and Denver (Suburban). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the U.S., economic growth is expected to pick up in the next several quarters following a turbulent opening quarter. Overall, occupier activity sustained last year’s momentum, leading to an increase in occupancy costs in 17 out of 22 U.S. markets covered in this survey. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mexico City remained the most expensive market in Latin America, posting an office occupancy cost of US$65 per sq. ft. and ranking as the 39th most expensive market globally. Both Brazilian markets, Rio de Janeiro and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, saw declines.&#13;

In the last 5 years FMCG companies leased predominantly Class A offices, 68% of take-up.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The study that was held for the first time in 2015, CORE.XP analyzed the office space occupied by 62 largest FMCG companies (total office area around 240,000 sq m).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Historically when choosing location for their offices FMCG producers preferred Class A premises located in the CBD. As a result 50% of the total office take-up of this segment is located within TTR. Though, following the general cost optimization trend of the last three years, FMCG producers prefer to lease office space beyond TTR (68% of take-up in 2013-2015).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
14 FMCG companies moved to new offices in 2015 occupying 22,000 sq m. 22 companies renegotiated their current lease terms (63,000 sq m), which was the record high figure.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Khoroshilova, Director of Global Corporate Services Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;On the back of import substitution programme implementation, we can expect activation of Russian food producers as well as international companies with local production which will continue to increase market share to cover falling import of food. The food imports share in retail stock has dropped down to 28% in 2015 from 34% in 2014 and continue to decline, to 24% in Q1 2016. So we can expect the growth of office space demand from the FMCG companies mentioned above. In addition decentralization trend will continue and FMCG companies will look for office space between TTR and MKAD.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

 FMCG is the most active segment of the Russia&amp;rsquo;s retail market, the biggest food chains declared plans to open 2,479 stores with total area of more than 2 mn sq m in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Opening of about 2,072 stores is announced by the market leaders, Magnit and X5 Retail Group. Magnit intends to open 80 hypermarkets and 950 neighbourhood stores, while X5 Retail Group – 1,000 Pyaterochka stores, 37 Perekrestok stores and 5 Karusel hypermarkets. This is less than a year earlier – 1,476 and 1,144 respectively. At the same time Magnit is actively developing neighbourhood cosmetics store chain – about 1,200 units are to be opened by the end of 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 International fast-food chains is the most dynamic sector of F&amp;amp;amp;B market in Russia. In total they are planning to open around 450 cafes by the end of 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Russian market is still very attractive for the international brands. Specifically, Moscow is still attractive for new players, as it is the major point of entry to the Russian market, and was ranked the 5th globally by the number of new foreign brands that entered the market in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Out of 33 new brands that have announced plans to enter the Russian market, 20 have already entered. The most active are fashion retailers – 11 brands have already entered or are planning to enter the market in 2016, and more than 50% of those companies are middle+ and premium brands. &#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Thus, the analysis of retail chains’ development plans has shown a direct correlation: the reduction of retail trade volume and stiffer competition give a head start for the largest retail chains, which use the current situation to increase their market share. The brightest examples are retail chains that have own production and logistics platforms enabling them to easily adjust assortment and prices&amp;rdquo;. &#13;

6 new shopping centres are expected to be opened by the end of the year.

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;On the back of oil price stabilization and ruble strengthening happened in the last several months, shopping centres recorded footfall increase. Nevertheless, the conversion rate of visitor to real purchaser is still low, limiting the pace of retailer sales growth. This in its turn translates into rental rates, which are almost 100% linked to retail sales. Thus, rental rates depend on consumer purchasing power, and their recovery may only start following income growth of population.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

Expectations are that for the entire year, investment volumes will reach and exceed the record volumes of 2015, with all CEE countries expected to perform strongly. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The second quarter was an exceptional period, with investment volume in the CEE region up 157% y-o-y. This high investment volume comes from a multitude of regional transactions &amp;ndash; over 60% of the total was closed in regional cities, especially in Poland, as well as from a record deal in Poland (the acquisition of 75% shares in the Echo Investments portfolio by Redefine). Also, Slovakia has seen a substantial increase in investment volumes, meaning €338 million for first half year (or 77% of full 2015 investment volume). The most attractive asset type in 2016 proves to be the retail sector – with a multitude of prime or close to prime deals closed, mostly in regional cities. Outside core-CEE countries, investment deals are scarce; with volumes continuing to be volatile and unpredictable. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 In general, yields have seen a stable evolution across all markets, with the exception being Hungary, where prime yields have compressed for offices, high-street retail and for retail warehouses, reflecting the ongoing negotiations for best-in-class assets. As from the start of the year prime yields have reached record low levels for this current economic cycle, further yield compression in Czech Republic and Poland are possible only on the basis of prime assets being transacted. Within other markets, as investors interest show signs of increase, new pricing levels will be established. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Investment volume in Russia is up substantially on a half year-basis, but a significant part of this growth comes from Q1 2016. The market saw the increase of activity in residential projects or development sites for residential properties (84% of the Q2 investment volume). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Although real estate investments in Q2 2016 were mostly concentrated in residential development sites, we see high investor interest for commercial property. Currently, over €2.7 bn equity is available to invest into commercial real estate in Russia, however, conversion rate is very low mainly due to the remaining gap in pricing expectations between buyers and sellers. With prolonged stability of oil price and ruble we expect this gap to tighten. We expect €4.1 bn of investment deals to be closed in 2016, half of this volume has already been realized in H1 2016.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Andreas Ridder, Chairman CEE, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “As we have predicted at start of the year, 2016 is rapidly reaching new record levels for the entire CEE region. While a slowdown might be expected in light of the recent political turmoil, interest for the region is strong, considering a solid macro-economic base and quality of assets available for transaction. If the rhythm of transactions continues, investors will face scarcity of attractive products, up for sale.” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In H1 2016 class A vacancy decreased to 19,3% from 26% at the end of 2015. To a greater extent this decrease in vacancy rate is related to withdrawal from the market of Eurasia Tower (93,900 sq m) and President Plaza (114,700 sq m), which will be potentially occupied by structures of VTB and Sberbank, respectively. These two towers accounted for 2.4% and 3% of vacancy rate in class A, respectively.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Two large buildings&amp;rsquo; take off the market had a positive impact on class A vacancy rate. But one must understand that these are non-market transactions: in reality, if excluding these buildings from calculations, class A vacancy rate fell by only 1.3 ppts. These type transactions are continuation of the trend that began last year, when large corporations with state participation and government authorities became active in the office market. On one hand it has positive effect on market indicators, on the other - it makes market forecasting even more difficult.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

According to the report, share of lease deals reached 100% in take-up structure &amp;ndash; at the moment new warehouse buildings at low prices represent the most popular product on the market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Take-up in H1 2016 totaled to 408,000 sq m, which is 13% lower than result of H1 2015. Though, overall business activity in I&amp;amp;amp;L Market was much higher: alongside leasing of new premises many companies continue expanding their space within currently occupied logistic parks. Closure of a number of big deals is expected in H2 2016, as a result annual take-up may reach 1 mn sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand will be focused on immediately available buildings of the primary market. Based on low volumes of speculative development, volume of a vacant space will stabilize at current level that will allow keeping the rental rates unchanged.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Ready-to-move-in warehouses are the top priority for tenants now. For such rapidly growing segments as large retail chains or e-commerce there is a great opportunity to start warehouse operations in a new building in a very short time. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite high volume of vacant space in total, number of options suitable for allocation of large distribution centers is limited to several projects even now and will decline further along with demand activity.&amp;amp;quot;</value></field><field name="DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="CODE"><value>moscow_region_industrial_big_box_q2_2016</value></field><field name="TAGS"/><field name="XML_ID"><value>1659</value></field><field name="IBLOCK_SECTION"/><property name="P_DIR"><value>413</value></property><property name="P_COUNTRY"><value>418</value></property><property name="P_FILE"/></item><item><field name="ACTIVE"><value>Y</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_FROM"><value>27.07.2016 12:46:00</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_TO"/><field name="SORT"><value>500</value></field><field name="NAME"><value>Investor Appetite Remained Strong across Europe in Q2</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_PICTURE"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT"><value>&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 27 July 2016, &amp;ndash; Commercial real estate investment remained strong across Europe in Q2 2016 totaling &amp;euro;54.0 billion, up 2.5 per cent on Q1 2016 and 30.4 per cent on the ten year average, although activity fell short of Q2 2015. The office sector had the strongest quarter, seeing an 8.3 per cent increase on Q1 2016, driven by a particularly strong performance in the Nordic region. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite uncertainty in the UK caused by the EU referendum, sentiment remained strong in other European markets and investment levels were stable year on year. Investment volumes in France and Sweden, Europe&amp;rsquo;s third and fourth largest markets, were particularly resilient; over the last year investment in these markets has grown 32 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Q2 2016 results in both France and Sweden were boosted by buoyant office sectors.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Ireland also performed extremely strongly, transacting a record €2.3 billion of commercial property deals in Q2 2016, more than double that of Q2 last year, although the sale of the Blanchardstown Centre for close to €1 billion closed during this quarter. Poland followed suit, transacting €1.5 billion in the second quarter, over three times the level recorded in the same period last year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Germany showed decreased levels of investment this quarter, likely connected to a lack of availability of stock in the core markets, which dampened the European total. Core property in Germany remains highly regarded as a safe haven and sentiment remains strong.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK also performed less strongly than its continental European counterparts in the run up to the Brexit vote although strong fundamentals continue to underpin the UK market. The recent depreciation of sterling, coupled with low interest rates, has attracted the attention of overseas investors to the UK, and with the spread between bond yields and property being the widest on record, the fundamentals of UK and continental European real estate remain attractive. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, managing director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Whilst investors have reacted cautiously to Brexit, the market fundamentals remain strong and investors still have significant capital to deploy. The uncertainty means that many investors will watch and see how the market develops before deciding how to act. However, sentiment is already improving as we enter a more stable political environment and there are signs that the market is responding positively to this.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Miles Gibson, Head of UK Research, CORE.XP, added:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;EU referendum risk was undoubtedly one factor affecting investment activity in Q2, but instability in the financial markets earlier in the year was similarly important in causing investors to be more risk averse.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Unlike most European markets, investors applied a wait and see approach in Russia in Q2 2016, mainly due to exchange rate uncertainty and general market volatility. However, appetite for commercial real estate still remains strong, with potential stabilization of the economy and Russian ruble we anticipate higher investment activity in Russia in H2 2016 and a total investment volume of $4.5 bn in 2016. So far in H1 2016 retail sector attracts the highest investor interest, followed by office and warehouse sector.”&#13;

According to the report, 15 shopping centres with rentable area of 638,000 sq m are announced to be delivered by the end of 2016. Part of them will probably be postponed until next year.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;8 new shopping centres with total rentable area of 266,000 sq m were delivered in Russian regional cities (St. Petersburg excluded) in H1 2016. Current total regional stock (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg) is 13 mn sq m.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As of H1 2016 penetration of modern shopping centres in megacities reached 366 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants, and in cities with less than 1 mn people penetration of shopping centres amounted to 261 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Yekaterinburg, Samara and Nizhniy Novgorod have the highest penetration of retail space per 1,000 inhabitants compared to other megacities.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Among cities with less than 1 mn of population, Krasnodar is still the leading market. The city&amp;rsquo;s 611 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants is the highest penetration among all Russian cities, even considering the agglomeration that includes Krasnodar itself and nearby cities.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;International retailers were cautious in regards of regional expansion in Russia in Q2 2016: only one brand &amp;ndash; Amsterdam Chips Company – chose regional market as a point of entry to the Russian market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In total, 4 international brands opened their first Russian stores in regions in H1 2016, and all of them in St. Petersburg. At the same time, retailers already existing in the Russian market, continue expansion in regional shopping centres. Availability of high-quality shopping centres rather than city itself is the major factor taken into account for the most of them.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mikhail Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail Department of CORE.XP in Russian Regions, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Regional retail market is still undersupplied, usually a new shopping centre in a small city turns out to be the first quality project, and it covers the whole market as well as provides great opportunity for international and federal brand stores opening. For example, the opening of Sunrise City in Naberezhnye Chelny will bring several Inditex’s brands, H&amp;amp;amp;M, LC Waikiki, Rive Gauche.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The amount of new shopping centre space completed across Europe declined in H1 2016 by 4% year-on-year to 1.30 million sq m, with construction levels for new schemes also seeing a fall of 21% year-on-year in 2016. However, shopping centre extensions under construction made up 21% of all new developments in the first half of 2016, an increase of approximately 50% year-on-year.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Shopping centre development activity has largely remained concentrated in Eastern European markets, with Russia accounting for 2.64 million sq m (28%) of total space under construction followed by Turkey with 2.22 million sq m (14%) of completed schemes in the first half of 2016. In Turkey, no new developments were announced in Istanbul due to the level of market saturation, but redevelopments may potentially increase. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The UK shopping centre pipeline of space under construction has increased to 441,400 sq m, a 75% increase on H1 2015, half of which are extensions on existing centres, notably the Westfield London Shopping Centre extension and the new Victoria Gate Shopping Centre in Leeds. Approximately 28 developments are expected to complete by the end of 2017. The UK&amp;rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union may result in a reduction in the number of future shopping centre developments due to a drop in consumer confidence and changes to regulations affecting property; but anything currently under construction is likely to still continue as planned with retailer demand for space remaining strong. The value of the Pound relative to other currencies such as the Dollar and Euro is also likely to make UK investment opportunities particularly attractive to overseas investors. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Ukraine there is 603,000 sq m of space currently under construction, which is 41% of the existing stock. The high pipeline volume, notably in Kyiv, is due to an improvement of economic fundamentals after an economic downturn in 2014 and 2015 that halted construction. Poland has a total of 524,000 sq m of new space under construction, in Warsaw there are still underdeveloped areas. In Poland a new law on retail sales tax may be introduced in September 2016, which may decrease profitably for the retail sector and lead to consolidation. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Nordics, Finland has the largest pipeline of space under construction, approximately 465,000 sq m, 22% of existing space. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Western Europe extensions and refurbishments to existing schemes comprise around a quarter of total construction due to lack of supply. France has 440,700 sq m, Italy has 425,700 sq m and Germany currently has 126,800 sq m. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Andrew Phipps, Head of UK and EMEA Retail Research, said: &amp;ldquo;The level of shopping centre completions and space in emerging markets such as Turkey and Russia have seen a slowdown in the first half of 2016, especially in Russia where development levels had peaked in 2014 and 2015, due to investor demand from oil revenue. However, we are seeing a trend towards extensions and refurbishments to existing centres, in particular in the UK, which will account for over 20% of new shopping centre completions in the next few years.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Michael Rogozhin, Managing Director of Retail department CORE.XP in Russia, comments: “Significant pipeline of new shopping centers in Russia can be explained by low retail penetration level in Russia which amounts to 146 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants at the moment. Highest retail penetration among largest regional cities (more than 1 mn inhabitants each) have Yekaterinburg, Samara and Nizhniy Novgorod - close to 500 sq m of retail per 1,000 inhabitants. Krasnodar is the leading market among cities with population less than 1mn inhabitants and has highest retail penetration in Russia - 611 sq m of retail space per 1,000 inhabitants (even including Krasnodar metro area). Another reason of significant construction pipeline is long construction period of shopping centers. Delivery of 30% of 2016 projects in Moscow was rescheduled from 2015. Same tendency is observed in regional markets.”  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Marina Malakhatko, Director, Moscow Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia, commented: “The shopping centers penetration in Moscow is much more higher than in the regions and will reach 458 sq m per 1,000 inhabitants by the end of 2016. But it is lower compared to the majority of the European capitals, and this is the factor of development stimulation. However, the jumping of bank rate in 2014 immobilized development and frozen a lot of projects. Recovery of quality retail development in 2016 occurred due to decrease of the refinancing rate to 10.5%, which brought down the project debt obligation.” &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In contrast, German hotel investment saw an increase of 34% Y-o-Y with transaction volumes reaching €2.02 billion in H1 2016. The German hotel investment market has proven to be the most attractive in Europe offering consistently high levels of liquidity and strong market fundamentals, at a time of wider European political and economic uncertainty. The large number of hotel assets encumbered by operational leases has continued to add to Germany&amp;rsquo;s appeal, particularly with the growing number of European institutional investors seeking low-risk investment opportunities.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The sale of the Hyatt Dusseldorf was the biggest single asset sale in Germany so far this year, with the hotel being operated under a management agreement, a relative rarity in the predominantly lease-focused German hotel landscape. This deal highlights the strong demand for assets offering upside exposure through management agreements and franchise opportunities in markets with solid fundamentals and good potential for performance growth.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Joe Stather, Information and Intelligence Manager EMEA, CORE.XP Hotels, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Germany remains a hot market for hotel investment and has taken the long-standing mantle from the UK which has dominated investment volumes in the last decade. The strong growth has been driven by over ten notable deals in Q2 including a significant portfolio transaction. Interest is coming from a diverse array of investors, including REITs, institutions, private equity and dedicated real estate investors.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Y-o-Y, the UK hotel real estate investment volumes saw a decline of 76% but in spite of this fall, fixed-income investment remained buoyant as investors continue to be attracted by the security of income. The UK leased hotel environment includes a number of hotel operators with highly regarded covenants and offering 25-year index-linked leases. Recent deals to reflect this trend include the sale of the Travelodge hotel in Liverpool Street, London for &amp;pound;42 million which was one of the few transactions post the UK’s EU referendum and demonstrates the high and resilient demand for leased hotel assets. The hotel development pipeline expects that over £2 billion of fixed-income stock is due to enter the regional UK market in the next three years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
France recorded 25% Y-o-Y growth in the second quarter of 2016 with deal volume totalling €508 million in the first six months of 2016. Transaction volumes were largely boosted by a number of deals on assets outside Paris. Recent investment activity has been focused on resort locations and the more leisure driven South of France region. The UEFA Euro 2016 football championship which was held in France in June also gave an uptick to hotel cash flows in many cities, and particularly in Paris.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Other notably deals which have taken place in H1 2016 include the sale of the Pullman Barcelona Skipper hotel, CORE.XP advised AXA Investment Managers – Real Assets, on behalf of its clients, to a Luxembourg based investment fund.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Investor interest in the hotel sector in Russia remains rather high predominantly generated by local, Asian and Middle Eastern buyers. Despite substantial difference between buyers and sellers pricing expectations, in H1 2016 we have recorded hotel investment volume of $565 mn or €496 mn (driven by one large deal, sale by Sberbank to the local purchaser of Gorki Gorod ski-resort in Sochi, Krasnaya Polyana for $467 mn or €410 mn) and anticipate further closings before end of the year.”&#13;

According to the new research, activity of demand in regional markets continues to grow. The deals volume in warehouse segment in Russian regions in the first two quarters of 2016 almost reached the result of the whole 2015. Food retailers continue to act as a main source of demand in Russian regional market&amp;ndash; 33% of H1 2016 take-up accounts for this segment activity.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
268,000 sq m of warehouse space was taken-up on regional markets in H1 2016. Lease transactions prevail in demand structure. The demand for a new warehouse space comes both from traditional pan-regional companies and from the local business.&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 8 September 2016 – The European industrial and logistics investment market experienced a record breaking amount of investment volumes in H1 2016, despite a slower Q2, according to the latest CORE.XP Industrial and Logistics MarketView. Lower than average activity in the UK amidst Brexit uncertainty meant logistics assets only made up 45 per cent of total turnover, instead of the usual 60 per cent, but the first half performance highlights the importance of this asset class.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the research, occupier demand held up well in H1 2016, despite a slowdown in activity during Q2, which in some markets, including the Netherlands, was quite pronounced. Other core markets performed strongly including Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic and the UK. Net absorption throughout Europe has remained positive, pushing vacancy rates down to a weighted 5.5%. In addition, many of these leading areas lack availability for modern warehouses or city depots, which has resulted in strong development activity and an increased share of speculative development in the areas, giving a further boost to said markets. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prime yields declined further in Q2, led primarily by Germany, France and Spain. Ahead of the Brexit vote, prime yields appeared to bottom out entirely, but a renewed downward pressure on interest rates is likely to reverse this effect. Nonetheless, investors are growing to be more risk averse, which is beginning to impact secondary values. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Machiel Wolters, Head of Research, Industrial and Logistics, EMEA, commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;While this quarter of the year was calmer, the industrial and logistics sector witnessed a record breaking amount of investment transactions in the first half of 2016. We continue to see a rise in development as a result of this demand, and new construction is providing a welcomed replenishment for Europe&amp;rsquo;s tight logistics market. Anticipation of the EU referendum stemmed market uncertainty in Q2 and impacted a wide variety of sectors. However now that the dust has settled, we anticipate the sector will gain further traction across investors throughout the European markets. “&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director of I&amp;amp;amp;L Department of CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Despite low share of industrial and logistics investment volume in H1 2016 in Russia, at 5.7%, there is still high investor interest to the sector. Noteworthy, the only deal with foreign capital was in this sector, Mubadala Development bought two buildings in PNK-Severnoye Sheremetievo and PNK-Chekhov III. Moreover, many end-users, in particular food retailers, using current situation to buy premises for future business development. Both, investors and occupiers are motivated with the fact that industrial and logistics sector is at the bottom now, and is expected to recover quicker compared to other sectors, as most of developers are constructing premises only for secured demand on a built-to-suit basis.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London &amp;ndash; Moscow, 12 September 2016 – The UK retained its position as the largest retail investment market in Europe for the third quarter in Q2 2016, with &amp;euro;3.5 billion worth of investment, according to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s EMEA Retail MarketView. This represents 27 per cent of all European retail investment, which totalled €12.8 billion Q2 2016. Germany was the second largest market, although activity in both countries was muted, down 21 per cent and 23 per cent respectively on Q2 2015, due largely to a lack of investible stock and subdued investor confidence amidst market volatility.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Short supply of core assets meant both the UK and Germany saw high levels of investment into regional centres. CORE.XP research shows that in the UK 79 per cent of retail investment targeted markets outside of London, whilst in Germany the top six cities accounted for just 22 per cent of total retail investment.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Central and Eastern Europe performed particularly strongly in Q2 2016, with €1.9 billion transacted. This is more than three times the total transacted in Q2 last year. The increase in activity was dominated by Redfine’s acquisition of 75 per cent shares in the Echo Investments portfolio in Poland.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Funds continued to be the dominant buyer profile in the European retail investment market, representing 28 per cent of all European retail investment, according to the report. Foreign buyers accounted for 44 per cent of European retail investment in Q2 2016, 20 per cent of which came from outside Europe. Middle Eastern buyers have been acquisitive, targeting core assets in Western Europe; most notably a prime retail holding on the Champs-&amp;Eacute;lys&amp;eacute;es in Paris, which sold to Qatari investors. US-based funds have also been noticeably more active in Q2, seeking investment opportunities in Europe’s recovery markets in Southern Europe and Ireland.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Despite market uncertainty, prime retail assets in EMEA continue to attract investment and yields continue to trend downwards. The low yielding bond market is further compounding the yield compression in prime retail. As such, the CORE.XP EMEA Prime Shopping Centre weighted average yield fell below five per cent for the first time.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;John Welham, Head of European Retail Investment at CORE.XP comments: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;We have seen consumer confidence begin to recover in Q2 2016 from the downward trend we saw in Q1 and prime retail space is very much in demand. However, occupier demand for secondary retail space remains weaker and therefore is not seeing the uplift in rents that we are beginning to see for core and prime assets. This situation is also reflected in the investment market, where demand for prime and core retail space is much stronger than for secondary assets. This is evidenced by the continued spread between prime and secondary yields, which remains high.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Olesya Dzuba, Director of Research Department CORE.XP in Russia said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“Investment into retail property in Russia has been low, because of the difference between buyers and sellers pricing expectations, as well as ruble exchange rate volatility. The total volume of retail investments in H1 2016 amounted to €57 mn, which is a mere 2.7% of total H1 investment volume. Investors want to enter the retail property now, as they understand the potential of recovery in the coming future after the asset value correction that happened in 2014-2015 on the back of ruble devaluation and consumer purchasing power decline.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>text</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los-Angeles &amp;ndash; Moscow, 22 September 2016 – Middle East investment in global commercial real estate reached nearly US$10 billion in H1 2016, with the target markets becoming more diverse, according to the latest research from global property advisor CORE.XP Group, Inc. &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investors from the Middle East have remained active buyers despite a slowdown in global investment turnover in H1 2016. Purchases of nearly US$9.8 billion account for over 20% of global cross-regional investment in H1 2016. Since being at the bottom of the market in 2009, investment from the Middle East has grown much faster than the market as a whole and faster than any other cross-regional investment. The sharp increase in investment was driven by Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)–in particular those from Qatar and the UAE. Capital flows are expected to remain high as SWFs increase the weighting of their portfolios and include a higher proportion of property. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

New York (US $6.5 billion) was the top destination for Middle Eastern investment in the 18-month period from 2015 to H1 2016, followed by London (US$4.7 billion), Singapore (US$2.5 billion), Hong Kong (US$2.4 billion), Paris (US$2.2 billion), and Milan (US$1.3 billion). The target destinations show a departure from recent history, with substantial activity in the U.S. and greater flows into Asia. Both of these regions had previously been under-represented in Middle East investment. This suggests a move to a more balanced distribution of assets to achieve greater diversification. With substantial ground still to make up, this trend can be expected to continue. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The destinations of investment flows from the Middle East are becoming more diverse and are no longer solely concentrated on London and New York City. Other U.S. cities such as L.A., Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Miami, as well as Asian markets are moving up on their agenda. The major Australian cities could be next. We expect investment flows from the Middle East to be substantial for the near future–interest in the hotels sector will remain strong, while the industrial and logistics sector will attract an increased share of capital,&amp;rdquo; said Chris Ludeman, Global President, CORE.XP Capital Markets. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The combination of a favorable exchange rate and economic growth has made the U.S. a leading target for Middle Eastern investors. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), recently purchased a 9.9% stake in the company that owns New York's iconic Empire State Building for $622 million. Purchases of US$9.8 billion in a single year in 2015 represents a significant ramping up of exposure to the U.S. market. This increase came partly as a result of two major transactions (QIA&amp;rsquo;s purchase of a 44% share in Manhattan West; Abu Dhabi Investment Authority’s acquisition of a U.S. industrial portfolio jointly with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board), which between them totaled well over US$5 billion. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Between 2008 and H1 2016, the Middle East accounted for 22.6% of cross-regional investment in the world’s 25 most popular cities for foreign acquistions. In absolute terms, London (US$28.5 billion) has seen by far the most investment from the Middle East. The purchase of major strategic assets in Hong Kong, Milan and Atlanta by SWFs account for the over-representation of Middle Eastern investors in those markets, whereas Houston has attracted investment from a range of different buyer types. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Markets where Middle Eastern investors are underrepresented may also be targeted in the future. Tokyo and San Francisco are popular destinations for other cross-regional investors and have attracted far less than their fair share of Middle Eastern capital. Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are all featured in the top 25 destinations for cross-regional investment; to date, they have attracted little investment from the Middle East. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Diversification by asset type is also influencing Middle Eastern investment activity, with the sector split seeing a material change last year. Between 2010 and 2014, the office sector dominated purchases by Middle Eastern investors, accounting for 53% of the total, with hotels a distant second at 17%. In 2015, hotels and offices were tied, with purchases totalling US$8.2 billion (35% of the total) in each sector. Industrial also saw a sharp increase in 2015 to 9% of the total, compared to just 3% over the previous five years. The industrial sector typically makes up a larger proportion of the market in North America than in other regions; if the strong flows into that region continue, so too should the growth in industrial investment. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Olesya Dzuba, Director of Research Department CORE.XP in Russia said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Middle Eastern investments amounted to USD1.6 bn for the period of 2003-H1 2016, of which up to USD100 mn were invested in 2016 year-to-date. Among the noteworthy deals is the Pokrovsky Hills sale to Qatar Sovereign Wealth Fund in 2014. Middle Eastern investor interest has increased recently: according to our estimates, about 15% of USD3 bn equity currently looking to invest into real estate assets in Russia is from Middle East.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Krasnoyarsk is number 14 out of 15 cities with the population of 1 mln people in regards of retail premises saturation level. At the same time this city has a very high purchasing power. That is why the new shopping centre in Krasnoyarsk is the most long-awaited in the region as there is almost 0% vacancy of quality shopping premises for retail chains development. Our major task, being the exclusive agent, is to create the unique concept of the shopping centre that meets all the requirements for the modern shopping and to attract new brands to the project. We are confident that the brands that are present in Krasnoyarsk market will be attracted by the high quality concept of the project and by the opportunity to open flagship stores there. And for those brands that are not present there yet our project is the unique opportunity to make themselves known.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Despite the fact that there are several shopping centres operating in Rostov-on-Don at the moment, the number of high quality shopping malls is not enough and they do not cover the whole city.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Build-to-suit deals again appeared in take-up structure &amp;ndash; 35% of Q3 transactions. Major part of demand within this sector was formed by one deal between BMW and PNK Group (CORE.XP was the consultant in this deal) – developer to construct 34,000 sq m building in PNK Bekasovo Logistic complex in 50 km from MKAD on Kievskoye highway in accordance with client&amp;rsquo;s requirements. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Demand will be focused on immediately available buildings of the primary market. Based on low volumes of speculative development, volume of a vacant space will stabilize at current level that will allow keeping the rental rates unchanged. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

 Anton Alyabyev, Director, Head of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;amp;quot;Moscow regional warehouse segment is in the new but predictable phase of development now which can be described by a larger differentiation of supply in terms of location and quality. This is reflected in base rents dynamics and vacancy in some directions. And though market adjustment is taking place selectively this is a good sign and it shows that this process will soon become more global.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Global prime retail rents grew by 3.7% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2016 from a year earlier, buoyed by consumer confidence in the U.S. and limited supply in Europe’s top retail markets. Regionally Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) saw the strongest year-on-year rental growth with an annual increase of 6.2% in Q2 2016. London and Milan showed some of the greatest rental growth, with much of Western Europe’s growth being driven by lack of supply in prime retail areas.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London takes the top spot for the fastest growing retail location by region as the capital registered annual prime rental growth of 53.8%, and London’s New Bond Street ranked third with the highest prime rental levels in the world ($1,684 per square foot per year in Q2 2016).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rome ranked second in the top 10 fastest growing retail locations and reported a 28.9% year-on-year growth as low availability in prime areas continued to drive rental growth, whilst making it difficult for international retailers to locate flagship stores. Milan was third with 20% prime rental growth in Q2 2016 and EMEA and had the fourth fastest growth rate amongst the global markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of UK &amp;amp;amp; EMEA Retail Research at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Retailers are continuing to see the importance of the physical store and are benefiting from having key stores in prime areas to grow their brand. It’s interesting to see that among the top five markets for rental growth are the traditional fashion capitals of London, Milan and New York, demonstrating that retailers are willing to pay high rents to be present in the most prime areas of these cities, often where supply and availability of space remains limited.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Other European markets among the top 10 for prime rental growth included: Sofia, Bulgaria (12.5%) and Warsaw, Poland (11.1 %). Asia Pacific saw two markets in the top 10: Auckland, New Zealand (23.7%) and Sydney, Australia (14%). The Middle East had one: Dubai (12.5%). And the Americas had two: New York (14.3%) and Seattle (11.1%).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The perennial top markets for global retail showed substantial divergence in the past year. Prime retail rents on New York’s Fifth Avenue between 56th and 58th streets increased by 14.3% in the past year to $4,000 per square foot per year as of this year’s second quarter. Meanwhile, prime rents on Hong Kong’s Russell Street declined by 33% to $1,856 per square foot per year amid a slowdown in tourist arrivals from the Chinese mainland and more prudent spending by locals.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The cooling off of China’s economy has manifest itself in sharply lower rents in Hong Kong, which has allowed a new crop of retailers to enter the coveted city,” said Anthony Buono, Chairman of CORE.XP’s Global Retail Executive Committee. “At the same time, prime retail rents in New York can remain stable, but in the near term we will see more landlord concessions to accomplish rate stability. London, however has such scant supply of available prime space that its strong rent growth is likely to continue.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Manhattan, many international and domestic retailers alike are willing to make substantial investments to establish a presence for their brand on the world stage of Fifth Avenue’s priciest blocks. Others are content to gravitate to nearby submarkets that are less expensive but still highly coveted as retail showcases, such as Times Square, Downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Olesya Dzuba, Director, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Retail premises in Moscow has become more affordable and took the 86th position in the rating of YoY changes of rental rates, which were down 5.9% in rubles for the last year. Rental rates in Moscow are at corrected down levels for the last two years, which attracts retailers to the market. Many newcomers have already used this opportunity and opened their stores in street retail and shopping centres. For the last several months the market has welcomed LeEco in Atrium SC, Cofix in Okhotny Ryad, Hunkemoller in MEGA Tyoply Stan and MEGA Khimky, Undiz MEGA Tyoply Stan, Lillapois Beauty in Troika, Jouvence Eternelle in Afimall CIty, Billabong in Aviapark.”&#13;

According to the report, the volume of new construction in CBD in 2017 will return to the levels of 2014-2015 and will reach approximately 100,000 sq m. Thus, about 75% of the new delivery in 2017 will localize in two key submarkets: Moscow-City and CBD.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2017 completions is likely to amount to 420,000 sq m, over a half of which will be contributed by two office buildings: IQ-quarter (130,300 sq m) and Federation Tower East (82,600 sq m).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Q4 2016 113,000 sq m of new office space is expected to be delivered. As a result 2016 completions volume is not likely to exceed 370,000 sq m, which is twice less than 2015 completions.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Take-up volume in Q3 2016 increased by 10% compared to Q3 2015 and amounted to 233,600 sq m. Class B accounted for 65% of this value or 152,900 sq m. The volume of transactions for new leases and acquisitions amounted to 790,700 sq m in total since the beginning of year, which is 45% above the value in Q1-Q3 2015. Medium-sized office premises with an area of 1,001-3,000 sq m were the most demanded in Q3 2016 (36% of take-up).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tenants and buyers have become more inclined to choose new Class A premises, for which prices and rental rates are still at reduced levels.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The volume of new transactions in Q4 2016 may reach 210,000 sq m and 1 million sq m for the whole 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
After a sharp decline of vacancy rates in Class A in Q2 2016, in Q3 vacancy dropped by 0.1 ppts and stabilized at 19.2%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Change in vacancy rates in class A resulted in a decline of overall vacancy in the market by 0.1 ppts for the quarter. Vacancy in Class B did not change as a significant amount of new construction (90%) contributed to Class B, which effectively replaced absorbed area.&#13;

The demand values, combined with low levels of new completion will lead decrease in vacancy rate by 0.2 ppts to 16.4% in Q4 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elena Denisova, Senior Director, Head of Office Department of CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Activity in the office market increased in Q3 2016. If in Q2 demand was largely maintained by two large transactions related to the settlement of debt, in Q3 the number of deals transacted at the market terms increased, which suggests that tenants and buyers have begun to make decisions and in some sense aware of the risk of &amp;amp;quot;closing window of opportunity&amp;amp;quot; for getting the best deal in the right building. The volume of lease renewals and renegotiations is gradually declining. We expect that this trend will strengthen in Q4. According to our forecasts, the volume of transactions for new leases and acquisitions of office spaces will reach pre-crisis levels of 2012-2013 by the end of 2016.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The architectural concept of ZELENOPARK shopping mall is a shopping street under the roof. The glass roof is giving the feeling of an open-space. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The total leasable area is 105,000 sq m. The major anchor tenants are Auchan, Leroy Merlin, Kidburg, Detskiy Mir, M.Video, INDITEX and LPP groups, H&amp;amp;amp;M, Gloria Jeans, Kiabi and many others. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The outlet gallery with the total area of 11,500 sq m with over 75 retailers will be integrated into the existing shopping centre. Additional part of the outlet zone is a comfortable lounge-zone with a piano. &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Free of charge pay stations and interactive screens are installed for the customers to support the sales. A separate VIP parking and a separate entrance are constructed for the customers. The first outlet stores will be opened in December 2016. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 This new outlet gallery will attract 7,000 visits of additional traffic. &#13;

 Marina Malakhatko, Director, Head of Moscow Retail, Russia, CORE.XP said: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;I am sure that we will be able to attract the most interesting brands to this project, in spite of another nearby existing outlet gallery by a different developer. Our competitive advantage lies in the fact that the presence of a shopping centre with all the classic anchor tenants allows you to keep high daily traffic. And the sales in outlet stores and restaurants will be more balanced during the week with no big difference between the traffic during weekdays and weekends, which essentially offers a unique business model for outlet tenants&amp;amp;quot;. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The report focuses on the prime office and prime retail locations of 20 global gateway cities, providing perspective on key variables such as economic trends; occupier trends; supply trends; rent trends; yield trends; and investment activity, so that investors can quickly and easily understand pricing and market conditions. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Milan, Munich, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington, D.C. are featured in the report as key targets for international investors. These cities were selected based on size, transport infrastructure, corporate presence, real estate investment flows and several other indicators of importance. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Global gateway cities offer many benefits to real estate investors. Their attractiveness to people and businesses means that space demand in commercial real estate markets increases steadily over the long-term, underpinning rental growth. These cities are highly liquid markets, where real estate investments can be readily bought and sold. Real estate in the global gateways provides capital protection and, in this era of low bond rates, a good income return. Lot sizes vary from small to huge, so large sums of capital can be deployed if necessary,&amp;rdquo; said Chris Ludeman, Global President, CORE.XP Capital Markets. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “We live in an age of cities. In emerging markets, they are hubs of explosive growth in production and distribution facilities. In the developed world, where the service sector drives economic activity, cities have reinvented themselves as vibrant live-work-play destinations. Millennials continue to flock to cities to work in the highly dynamic sectors of tech, fashion and high finance,” said Dr. Richard Barkham, Global Chief Economist, CORE.XP. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “The great gateway cities are world-class transport hubs; they are networked into the global economy via their ports and airports, and to their hinterlands via the road and rail network. Their Central Business Districts, with extensive stock of modern offices, host national and regional corporate headquarters and the legal, accountancy and consulting services these require. These cities have highly diversified economies with many sectors and subsectors, which, alongside their entrepreneurialism, makes them highly resilient to the ebb and flow of economic events,” Mr. Barkham added. &#13;

 Marina Chernyakova, Associate Director, Moscow Retail, CORE.XP: “We are glad to present Muscovites with a new chain of perfumery supermarkets, Golden Apple, that sells not only exclusive luxury brands but also goods of daily demand. And this is chain’s competitive advantage, it clearly stands out from the other chains of the same segment. Kuntsevo Plaza is an ideal location for Golden Apple. I believe that despite of high competition in perfumery segment, Golden Apple will win the hearts of the Moscow shoppers”.  &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Q3 2016 was overall more positive compared to the first half of 2016 with the decline in deal volumes only down by 6% compared to a strong Q3 2015, according to the latest figures from global commercial property advisor CORE.XP. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Q3 2016 saw Spanish hotel investment record the highest year-on-year growth of 162%, with transaction volumes reaching €537 million. This was largely driven by strong investor demand to buy and capitalise on the improving economic and performance recovery which has continued to gather pace. Transactions this quarter spanned the country, including gateway and secondary cities and resort locations. A notable transaction was the five-star Pullman Barcelona Skipper, 241-keys and sold off a guide price of €90million. Italy and Ireland have also seen a year-on-year increase of 135% and 106% respectively in Q3 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The German hotel investment market has remained the most attractive to investors with transaction volumes reaching €856 million in Q3 2016. Germany continues to offer consistently high levels of liquidity and strong market fundamentals.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Joe Stather, Information and Intelligence Manager EMEA, CORE.XP Hotels, said: &amp;ldquo;European hotel transaction volumes continue to reflect the challenging current climate and the decline is in line with the slowdown across all mainstream European commercial property. However, the rate of negative growth in hotels is slowing and a strengthening deal pipeline in the UK, Spain and Italy suggests more buoyant deal volumes for the beginning of 2017.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jorge Ruiz Andres, CORE.XP Hotels, Spain, said: “Investor appetite for Spain is soaring on the basis of strengthening economic fundamentals, performance growth across the country and attractive asset pricing relative to other consolidated European destinations. The liquidation of non-performing loans will heighten transaction activity in the market over the coming months and we also recognise a number of value-add and core opportunities for more conservative sources of capital.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Head of Research, Russia, CORE.XP: “The volume of hotel investment in Russia increased to USD627 mn in Q1-Q3 2016 from 34 mn in Q1-Q3 2015, mainly because of the sale of large Gorki Gorod ski resort in Krasnaya Polyana in H1 2016. We observe high investor interest for the hotel sector during last two years. The reasoning, firstly, is in their relatively stable nature for capital preservation and gains, secondly, in its potential for value recovery after ruble devaluation, especially taking into account that all hotel income is in rubles. Moreover, the expectation of hotel values growth is supported by ADR and occupancy positive dynamics in 2016”.&#13;

However, contrary to expectations, 70% of millennials prefer to shop in a store instead of online and this is unlikely to dramatically change in the future, according to new research from CORE.XP, the global property advisor.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP has conducted one of the most extensive and detailed global research projects which surveyed 13,000 millennials aged between 22 and 29 across 12 countries to understand how they approach lifestyle choices through live, work and play and what this means for future trends in real estate.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Millennials are the first generation to be true digital natives. This immediate access to any part of the online world has driven an increased belief that immediate gratification is something to achieve in all aspects of life. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Almost half of the respondents want to be able to have a desired product immediately and they want to be able to see, touch, feel, test and try out the product in store. While a total of 27% of shopping is done online by the majority of millennials, popularity of online shopping varies dramatically by country due to the differing retail dynamic in each country. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In countries which have an established international network of retailers, it is likely that online penetration will be higher than those where retailers are more focused on local markets. When the &amp;lsquo;millennial shopper&amp;rsquo; does buy online they want the items delivered to their own home. A significant two thirds of people said they preferred home delivery, followed by delivery to place of work while ‘click and collect’, lingered as a third option. Leisure is also an increasingly important part of a millennial’s life and 50% of their income goes on eating out, shopping, visiting the cinema and going to live events. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The findings from the report also reveal that this generation of young adults are facing significant challenges in finding affordable places to live. This is largely attributed to the high cost of residential property and rents coupled with a lack of suitable jobs. Nearly half (49%) of all respondents surveyed, still live at home with their parents and 74% say that wages are not keeping up with property prices, which is one of the main reasons that they are still living with family. A total of 65% cited the reason they rent instead of buying a property due to financial circumstances.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The survey also looked at what millennials want from a job. A total of 64% of millennials consider themselves fortunate to have a job and that working for a small number of companies during their career is something that they aspire to. However, the level of loyalty to a company is ranked low and workers will move jobs if the right salary, learning and development and opportunity to work with similar minded people arises. According to the CORE.XP research, 78% of respondents see the quailty of the workplace as a key factor when choosing an employer. While salary and benefits remain the main draw when considering a job, when money is removed from the equation, work/life balance stands out along with other factors such as better office environments. In fact, 69% of respondents said that they would be willing to give up other benefits for a better office environment, underlining the increasing pressure on developers and landlords to create the optimium work environment for attracting and retaining top talent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of EMEA &amp;amp;amp; UK retail at CORE.XP said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The findings of our global research have dispelled some assumptions and reinforced others. The fact that millennials have joined the workforce during a time of global economic change has had a profound impact on places they work, live and play. From a retail perspective it is a certainty that the physical store retains its position of importance in the shopper’s journey. Online is seen to complement the in-store shopping as opposed to a direct alternative. This means that the need for retailers to create compelling experiences to ensure shoppers have a reason to visit again and again has never been greater. It's a truism that millennials are the future and an in–depth understanding of what they want, and importantly, what they don't want, is key.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Head of Research, Russia, CORE.XP: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“People born in 2000’s today are already the major demand driving force for retail, and in five years this generation will form the basis of labor force. And this tendency is true for the majority of the developed countries with similar demographic model or reproduction population. That is why all retail market participants, both retailers and developers, need to take into account behavioral peculiarities of these people. For example, Russian millennials spend up to 50% of their income on leisure, entertainment and eating outdoor. And this is affecting the shopping centre tenant mix, where the volume of occupied premises of entertainment and food and beverage (excluding food courts) for the last five years increased two times to occupy 16% and more of shopping centre gross leasable area on average”. &#13;

The report analyses the characteristics of tech clusters and explores future opportunities among high-performing, and emerging, tech cities across Europe. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Out of 35 cities across Europe, London is ranked in first place in CORE.XP’s index; followed by Paris in second, Berlin in third place and Munich and Madrid completing the top five. The report also identifies the fastest-growing, emerging European tech cities of the future as Bucharest, Budapest, and Istanbul. &#13;

The key findings from the report include:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The rate of employment growth in the tech sector over the past five years has far exceeded the rate of growth for office-based employment as a whole, and the sector is expected to continue to outperform. Berlin, Dublin, London, Munich and Vienna, as well as a group of fast-growing emerging markets including Bucharest, Budapest, and Istanbul have seen particularly rapid growth. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Across a group of major European office markets, the proportion of leasing by technology companies has grown steadily from under 10% in 2008-2009 to over 16% in 2016, surpassing the contribution of the banking and finance industry during this period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;London, Munich and Paris dominate hi-tech patent applications to the European Patent Office. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Technology encompasses a diverse group of activities and some tech hubs have attracted particular sub-sectors. This is important in identifying sources of demand and other real estate opportunities. For instance, digital advertising takes its greatest share in Berlin; while IT services requirements have a greater proportion in Budapest.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Richard Holberton, Senior Director, CORE.XP Research said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;London and Paris are the leading European tech markets, and benefit from strong demand from a wide range of occupier types and sizes. However, our research shows that there are a wide variety of attractive tech locations: other cities that feature in the top ten include Berlin, Madrid, Dublin and Budapest. Outside this list of the top twenty markets Hamburg, Sofia and Warsaw are increasingly important European tech hubs. Cologne, Turin and Utrecht continue to see high concentrations of employment in the sector, while Lyon and Zurich are expected to see stronger growth in tech employment than some larger markets.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;The IT &amp;amp;amp; telecom sector is one of the most perspective for office sector development in Moscow. The latter is stipulated by the level of technological requirements, as well as government support for the research and development of the IT industry in Russia, which imply tax benefits and education schemes. Moscow is the fourth (among 35 in the sample) in terms of employed in this sector people (according to ICT Employment City 2015), as well as ranked the fifth in Startup category of European Digital City Index 2015. The further sector development will be mostly in Internet services and Software sub-sectors, due to rapid digitalization of all spheres of economy.”&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 23 January 2017 &amp;ndash; European commercial real estate recorded its strongest quarter of the year in Q4 2016 with investment volume reaching a record high of &amp;euro;86.8 billion. This total represents an increase of five per cent on Q4 2015, which held the previous record for investment volumes. A very buoyant German market provided a significant boost to the European total, with volumes reaching a record of €19.8 billion in Q4 2016. The Netherlands also saw the largest ever year-on-year growth with investment up 17 per cent on 2015 to €13.5 billion. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Overall, total investment activity in 2016 reached €251.1 billion; a 10 per cent decrease on 2015, due to a weaker first half of the year. Excluding the UK, total investment volumes for the year rose five percent from €182.7 billion in 2015 to €190.9 billion in 2016. Uncertainty in the UK surrounding the EU referendum as well as other factors, including Chinese financial market turbulence, reduced global capital flows causing investment levels to fall across the EU. Despite this, the industrial sector in UK and indeed in the rest of Europe, bucked the overall market trend, outperforming every other sector with a four per cent increase in investment volumes on 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Sentiment picked up significantly in the second half of 2016 and investment levels for most of Europe were generally either stable or up on 2015. Commercial real estate investment in Spain and the Netherlands were particularly resilient. In 2016, more than €13.5 billion was invested in Dutch commercial real estate alone. This surpassed the previous highest record of €13.2 billion in the Netherlands in 2007. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Germany also performed strongly, with a record fourth quarter of €19.8 billion bringing investment turnover above the €50 billion mark for the year. Germany is considered one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most in-demand investment markets by property investors, and core property in Germany remains highly regarded as a safe haven. &#13;

In 2016, investment in the UK market recorded a 28 per cent decrease compared to 2015 when measured in sterling (37 per cent in euros). This differential demonstrates the impact of the depreciation of the pound which occurred following the EU referendum in June 2016 and follows an all-time record for total UK property investment in 2015 of €94.8 billion. Following the fall in value of the pound, in the later part of 2016 the UK market has seen increased interest from foreign capital as the UK now offers much better value for non-sterling denominated buyers. Property continues to offer a significant premium over returns on the bond market and the fundamentals of UK and continental European real estate remain attractive. As such, UK investment volumes improved moderately quarter on quarter from €11.9 billion in Q3 2016 to €15.1 billion in Q4 2016.&#13;

Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Continental European markets continued to perform strongly in the latter half of 2016 with investors prepared to pay a premium to secure the best product. Germany maintains its position at the top of investors’ wish list for core property assets and is likely to continue to be seen as safe haven for global capital. Interest and sentiment in the London market is improving and the devaluation of sterling made prime London assets particularly attractive to overseas buyers. The UK’s economic fundamentals remain strong and this will underpin investor confidence in 2017.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

“The 2016 investment volume in Russia amounted to €4.1 bn ($4.5 bn), being 36% higher than the same period of 2015. About 34% of this amount has been formed by the government sector deals, while there were no such deals in 2015. There was still significant mismatch between buyer and seller expectations that in some cases prevented deal closure. Meanwhile, there is high investment activity in the market. On the back of stability and expectations of gradual economic and market recovery, as well as understanding of available capital that is looking to invest in real estate in Russia, we forecast the investment volume in 2017 to be at €4.5 bn ($5 bn)”.&#13;

High investor activity of last year was inefficient because of significant mismatch between buyer and seller expectations that prevented deal closure. As a result, the volume of real market deals was down by 10% compared to 2015, and amounted to almost USD3bn. We expect more stability and gradual economic and real estate market recovery this year, which together with pent up demand allows us to forecast investment volume to be at about $5 bn in 2017.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;amp;quot; Important changes took place on the warehouse market in 2016. From negative dynamics observed over the last two years the market turned towards stabilisation. At the same time new demand sources appear on the market: some companies move from old warehouse to class A properties, another consolidate supply chain in new space. In 2017 we expect strengthening of trends we saw last year and gradual improvement of market environment &amp;ndash; further movement from stabilization to growth.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

According to the report, low completions and increasing tenant activity starting from Q3 2016 have led to the &amp;lsquo;washing&amp;rsquo; of high-quality assets, especially notable in the supply of larger premises. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;2016 became the year of leveling the balance on the market and stabilization of the key indicators and formed the base for the gradual transition from a tenant market to a landlord market. Justifying our forecasts, take-up reached the pre-crisis level of 2013. On the back of record low volume of completions vacancy rate has been steadily declining throughout the year. Occupiers activity increased substantially in the second half of the year and, importantly, was converted into market transactions. Demand from large Russian business, as well as government sector demand on quality office buildings, which maintained office property market for the last two years, expected to be high in 2017.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Retail real estate market in Moscow in 2016 has been stable. On the one hand, delivery of new shopping centres made saturation with quality premises in Moscow close to boundary value of 500 sq m per 1000 people. On the other hand, this high level of penetration has not become a constraint for vacancy decline after significant increase (to 11.4% in Q3 2016) on the back of new shopping centre openings, albeit the vacancy rate declined to 10.2% at year end.

Germany, Norway, Spain and CEE all reported record trading activity for the year meaning 2016 volumes were four per cent higher than in 2015.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition to historically high investment volumes, 2016 was a record year for take-up in Europe. Total take-up volumes for the nine core markets of the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic reached the 21 million square metre mark for the first time, outperforming the previous mark of 19 million square metres in 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy all had record years in terms of take-up, significantly impacted by the rise in demand from the e-commerce and retail industries. In the United Kingdom, over 50 percent of the 2.8 million square meters of take-up can be attributed to these two industries. Supply chain logistics are adapting accordingly to the occupier shift, which has further stimulated construction and manufacturing improvements to support growth and competitiveness. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

However, the impact on vacancy rates across Europe remained modest, with the weighted average for the core markets moving up by 20 bps y-on-y from 5.1 to 5.3%. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Amaury Gariel, Managing Director of EMEA Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics at CORE.XP commented: &amp;ldquo;Logistics has become the fastest-growing sector in real estate across Europe, and is perceived as the least politically sensitive asset class. In 2016, the sector took the title of best performing asset class and continues to attract significant investor interest and capital. Institutional funds remain attracted by stability in Germany and Norway, whilst the favorable economic outlook for Spain and CEE provides solid fundamentals for future growth.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Vacancy rate has stabilised and demand has recovered on warehouse market of Moscow region. Those are signals of gradual improvement of market environment. Supply volume will contract further, to 500-600 thousand sq m in 2017, new buildings will be built mainly for specific clients. Dynamics of positive changes may strengthen in second half of the year along with vacancy decrease and growth of rents. Take-up is forecasted at 0.9-1 mn sq m in 2017. As a result of lower delivery and strong demand, the vacancy rate may decline to up to 11%.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New territories were annexed in 2012 and we can already observe dynamic reclamation of New Moscow territories by commercial and residential real estate developers. Large land area is ideal for new office real estate format development, such as business parks and districts. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to the report, Class B office stock on the annexed territories amounts to 290,400 sq m and is represented by Rumyantsevo, Vysota, and Borovsky business centres. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Class A office stock amounts to 174,800 sq m and represented by Comcity, G10, K2, business centres. This list will be topped up soon by the first lifestyle centre in Russia – Neopolis business district. &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Neopolis construction in TNAO allowed to realize new for the Russian market office centre concept, where advantages of modern business district is supplemented by social infrastructure helping to balance life with work. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand for offices in the business centres located in the New Moscow was under negative impact of worsening macroeconomic situation in the country and reduction of business activity in 2015-2016. Take-up amounted to 5,100 sq m in 2015 which is by 84% lower than in previous year. In 2016 take-up amounted to 5,700 sq m.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Development of New Moscow territories and construction of high-quality business centres changed the structure of demand – class A segment was dominating in recent years, so all transaction were in business centres of this class in 2016. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2016, financial, medical and pharmaceutical companies were the main occupying sectors. The vast majority of companies are Russian, 99% in 2015 and 91% in 2016.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Large premises with area of more than 5,000 sq m formed almost all annual take-up until 2015. In the last two years the share of small premises has significantly increased in the volume of demand. Offices of up to 500 sq m accounted for 39% of take-up in 2016 and offices of 501-1,000 sq m – 18%.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Large areas of New Moscow land allow to develop conceptually new product, to realize new business areas with advanced business and social infrastructure. Thanks to social component, office centres in New Moscow became point of attraction not only for the business, but also for the population of new territories. For example, we supplemented environment in our business district with various infrastructural objects, so that the people not only work on the complex territory, but evolve as well&amp;rdquo;, Svetlana Grigorieva, Marketing Director of Neopolis Business District pointed.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The office market of New Moscow has a high potential for new construction. The factor of success of the business centre in this submarket is its proximity to MKAD, outbound routes and metro stations. There is a trend of improving quality of offices due to decentralization in the Moscow office market. As the Moscow transport network develops, MKAD will cease to be a psychological barrier for tenants, as the accessibility of the projects in New Moscow will be comparable with objects adjacent to MKAD on the inner side”, Olesya Dzuba, Head of Research, CORE.XP Russia added. &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Germany most popular European country for second consecutive year &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nordics climb the rankings at city and country level&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Berlin shows the biggest increase, jumping to second place from fourth in 2016&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Cannes - Moscow, 15 March 2017 &amp;ndash; London has been ranked as the most attractive European city for real estate investment for the sixth consecutive year, according to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s annual Investor Intentions Survey being launched at MIPIM 2017. Seventeen per cent of respondents cited London as their preferred destination for real estate investment. Berlin has jumped to second place in 2017 from fourth in 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In terms of the immediate challenges impacting the acquisition of real estate assets, availability of product and pricing of assets were considered the greatest obstacles facing investors this year. This is reflected in the results for some of the gateway cities in Europe, with Hamburg, Milan and Munich dropping out of the top 10, and Paris retaining a top-5 position as one of Europe’s most attractive cities, expressing keen interest in the city despite aggressive pricing and potential political risk. Meanwhile Oslo and Stockholm were prominent new entries in the top 10 most attractive investment cities, reaffirming the strong investor interest in the Nordics.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Whilst London was ranked the most attractive city, Germany has retained the top spot as the most attractive country for real estate investment in EMEA, preferred by 22% of respondents in the CORE.XP survey. The UK (20%) was once again the second most popular country and both Germany and the UK have increased in popularity from the previous year, up from 17% and 15% respectively in 2016. Investors value their relatively high liquidity and transparency.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Nordics, with 10% of the vote, entered the top three, rising from seventh in 2016. The increased popularity of the Nordics was also reflected in high levels of investment activity during 2016, with its favourable risk return profile driving volumes 66% above the ten-year average. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investors also continue to show a greater desire to acquire property than dispose of it. According to the survey, 85% of investors intended to spend at least as much in 2017 as in 2016 and 41% expected to spend more. Investment style is also shifting. There is now a lower preference for core stock with investors showing a greater propensity (41%) to invest in good secondary or value–add opportunities. Whilst this differed between markets, it reflects a desire for assets where active management can be used to enhance returns in a growing economic environment where yields are compressed and interest rates are likely to rise.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Offices are perceived to be the most attractive sector in 2017, although its lead over other sectors is contracting. Investors now perceive industrial and logistics as the second most attractive sector, motivated by structural changes such as the broad-based integration of e-commerce in the supply chain and the development of logistics as an institutional investment product.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The survey also highlighted the increasing attraction of alternative investment sectors, with 71% of respondents indicating that they had already invested in alternatives whilst 64% are actively pursuing opportunities in the sector. &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;While 2017 will be an eventful year, with several major elections in Europe, investors’ focus appears to be more concentrated on the economic climate rather than geo-political events. The most frequently cited risk for 2017 was &amp;ldquo;faster than expected interest rate rises&amp;rdquo;. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Jos Tromp, Head of EMEA research at CORE.XP comments: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The spread between property yields and bond yields remains close to historic highs and is consequently one of the primary motivators in attracting investors to the sector. However, in an environment of continued economic and political uncertainty, the defensive characteristics, capital value growth and attractive income profile of real estate remain important drivers of continued investor interest in the sector.”&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonny Hull, Managing Director of EMEA Investment Properties at CORE.XP adds: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Europe remains a key target for property investors globally and the economic outlook for the European economy remains positive. Whilst the core markets of the UK and Germany remain the largest investment destinations, markets such as the Nordics and CEE are increasingly important components of global investment strategies. Furthermore, cities such as Madrid and Dublin are both ranked within the top 15 most attractive European investment destinations, highlighting the popularity of Europe’s recovery markets as investors seek value-add investment opportunities.”&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Olesya Dzuba, Director, Head of Research, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  “The share of foreign investment capital in Russia went down to 4% in 2016 from 15% in 2015. The major reasons for this were the lack of investment product and significant gap between pricing expectations of buyers and sellers, which can reach up to 25-30%. Nevertheless, there is a huge interest from foreign investors, about half of equity capital that is looking to invest in Russia are foreign, according to our estimates. Apart from western European and US investors that have already been present in Russia, more interest is coming from Middle East and Asia.”&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Methodology&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
  The investor intentions survey was carried out between 26th December 2016 and 4th February 2017. The survey attracted 1,968 respondents globally. This report covers the 501 respondents who indicated to be responsible for investments in EMEA. &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  The responses were spread across a range of investor types. The most numerous were fund / asset managers, who accounted for 43% of survey participants. Insurance companies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds were responsible for 12%. The other most numerous respondents were private equity (9%), private property companies (9%), listed property companies (inc. REITs) (9%) and developers (6%).&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  The respondents were predominantly investors domiciled in Europe (85%). UK-domiciled investors were the most numerous, making up 26% of the total, followed by Germany (11%), the Netherlands (10%), and France (5%). Investors from elsewhere in Western Europe accounted for 26% of survey participants. The respondents from outside Europe were mainly from North America (8%). &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CORE.XP analyses luxury segment in Russia&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;29 new luxury brands opened their stores in 2015-2016 in Moscow&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Moscow, 16 March 2017 &amp;ndash; According to the findings of the latest research from CORE.XP, the global property advisor, luxury goods market in Russia demonstrated stability in 2016, mainly due to a shift in demand, influx of Chinese tourists and reduced prices from a number of retailers. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 On the back of the crisis and income decline the number of Russians traveling to Italy, Spain, France, and Germany declined by 32% in 2015-2016 compared to 2013-2014. Consumers started to spend money inside the country, including luxury clothes and shoes. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The report showed that the reduced prices (10-25%) for luxury goods from the largest retailers made Moscow competitive to Milan. The prices in Russia are lower than in Asia. This step led to the increased number of purchases by foreigners, mainly by Chinese tourists. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 On the back of the formed comfortable conditions (signage and services in the Chinese language) and preferences (tax free, option to use China UnionPay, visa-free travels by groups of 5-to-50 people for up to 15 days) for the Chinese, number of tourists from China increased by 28.5% in 2015 and 15% in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;

 Despite the downturn in the economy, Russia remains one of the key markets for almost all global luxury brands. This is reflected in new stores openings, as well as in the expansion of the existing stores. About 42% stores opened in Russia during 2015-2016 compared to 2013-2014. Among the brands that turned into direct operation for the last three years are Bvlgari, Gucci, Burberry, Tiffanу&amp;amp;amp;Co. and Hermes. &#13;

 Moscow remains one of the 10 world's most expensive office markets &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Los Angeles - Moscow &amp;mdash; March 24, 2017 — Hong Kong is the world&amp;rsquo;s highest-priced office market, according to CORE.XP Group, Inc.’s new Global Prime Office Rents survey. European markets showed the most consistent growth in prime office rent, mostly due to a lack of supply. Belfast (up 25 percent year-over-year) led the way among the 121 cities surveyed. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Hong Kong had two of the top three most expensive office markets. Hong Kong’s (Central) held the top spot with prime office rent of US$264 per sq. ft. per year and Hong Kong (West Kowloon) (US$163 per sq. ft.) was third. Rounding out the top five were two Chinese markets -- Beijing (Finance Street) (US$179 per sq. ft.) at #2 and Beijing (Central Business District (CBD)) (US$156 per sq. ft.) at #4 -- and London’s West End (#5) (US$146 per sq. ft.). The most expensive market in North America was New York (Midtown Manhattan), number six on the global list, with a prime office rent of US$144 per sq. ft. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Global prime office rents—which reflect rent, excluding local taxes and service charges for the highest-quality, &amp;ldquo;prime&amp;rdquo; office properties—rose 2.3 percent compared with a year-earlier for the 12 months ended [December 31, 2016], with EMEA up 3.7 percent and Asia Pacific and the Americas each up 1.8 percent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Four of the top five fastest-growing (prime office rents) markets were in Europe, with Stockholm, Berlin and Dublin joining Belfast on the list. Chicago (Downtown), with rent growth of 19.9 percent was the top market in the Americas and was number two on the global list. Hong Kong (West Kowloon) with a rent rise of 9.3 percent was the top growth market in Asia. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “We expect the global economy to pick up momentum with growth boosted by fiscal expansion in the U.S.,” said Richard Barkham, global chief economist, CORE.XP. “Growth was underpinned by positive monetary conditions in Europe and increased government spending in China, both of which are expected to continue.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 CORE.XP tracks office rents for prime office space in 121 markets around the globe. Of the top 50 “most expensive” markets, 20 were in Asia Pacific, 19 were in EMEA and 11 were in the Americas.  &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Europe Middle East &amp;amp;amp; Africa (EMEA)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Europe has seen the strongest rent increase due to low supply and high demand. Stockholm, Berlin and Dublin had significant rent growth. However, rents in London’s West End fell by 6.3 percent as activity waned in the wake of the Brexit referendum. In Istanbul, rents fell by 11.1 percent, largely due to political instability in the area. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 30 of the 56 EMEA markets recorded a year-over-year increases in prime office rents. &#13;

 Elena Denisova, Senior Director, Head of Offices, CORE.XP, Russia comments: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Class A Prime business centres, which are distinguished by exclusive location, quality and good views, engage 7% of the volume of quality office stock in Moscow. Rental rates in these buildings, retaining the denomination in US dollars, stabilized in 2016 after the downward trend of previous 1,5 years that was typical for the whole market on the back of recession. Despite greater affordability of the prime offices, Moscow is among cities with the highest maximum rental rates, taking 10th place in the ranking in the end of 2016 globally, after New Delhi, Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, London, Beijing and Hong Kong. This position is explained by constantly low vacancy in the segment, the specifics and stability of main tenants (international and large Russian companies of financial and business services sectors) and almost absent delivery of new supply because of current restrictions on construction in the Central part of the city. The current conditions are the most attractive to lease quality space in premium locations.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Asia Pacific &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 Asia Pacific led the list of most expensive prime office rents with seven of the top 10 most expensive markets—Hong Kong (Central), Beijing (Finance Street), Hong Kong (West Kowloon), Beijing (CBD), Tokyo (Marunouchi/Otemachi), Shanghai (Pudong) and New Delhi (Connaught Place - CBD). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Prime rent growth in Asia Pacific averaged 1.8 percent and was strongest in gateway cities. Hong Kong (West Kowloon) led the way at 9.3 percent due to strong demand from Chinese companies for premium locations and very tight supply conditions. Technology start-ups have played a key role in the fastest-growing markets in Asia Pacific, such as Bangalore, Sydney, Bangkok and Auckland. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$78 per sq. ft.), in 20th place. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Americas&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
 In the Americas, three markets—Chicago (Downtown), Seattle (Suburban) and Seattle (Downtown) showed double-digit growth in prime office rents year-over-year, due to a lack of new construction in Chicago and technology growth in Seattle. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Several markets dependent on the oil and gas industry experienced lowered prime office rents, including Calgary (Downtown and Suburban), Houston (Downtown) and Denver (Downtown). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Overall, office rents increased in 19 out of 34 U.S. markets covered in this survey. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Mexico City was the most expensive market in Latin America, with prime office rent of US$50 per sq. ft. and ranking as the 40th most expensive market globally. Prime office rents in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo declined but Buenos Aires saw a modest increase. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The first Pompa store was opened in December 2016. The chain is planning to open other six stores in the Russian capital in 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of Oceania shopping centre is 137,000 sq m (GLA 60,000 sq m) and an underground parking for 1,100 cars. It was commissioned in 2016. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total area of the first Pompa store in Moscow is 102 sq m. The Pompa chain has currently 80 stores in 40 regions around Russia. This modern brand offers business clothes for young women over 25 years old in mid segment.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olga Korolevskaya, consultant, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP commented: &amp;amp;quot;For the past 22 years Pompa stores attracted buyers in St. Petersburg and the regions. When entering the Moscow market, we focused, primarily, on the success of the shopping centre. That is why Oceania was selected as the best project in 2016 . As we can see, the brand found its customers who chose the winter collection of designer coats. After all, the average check in Pompa store is 15,000 rubles.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CORE.XP analyzed public sector companies&amp;rsquo; activity in the Moscow office market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;State companies and organizations became the leading sector in office demand structure in 2015-2016&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Government sector transacted 52% more new office deals in 2015-2016 compared to the previous crisis of 2008-2009&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Moscow, 28 March 2017 &amp;ndash; According to CORE.XP, the global property advisor, public sector share in the total take-up went up to the record 36% in the end of 2016. According to CORE.XP forecasts, the companies of public sector will target business centres outside CBD of Moscow for relocation in the nearest future.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Public sector purchased and leased 1.82 mn sq m of office space during the last decade, from 2007 to 2016. The activity of such companies has increased during the crisis period of 2008-2009, in 2011 (due to a major transaction of Rostelecom that leased 48,100 sq m in Comcity businss park) and in the last two years with the worsening economic situation in the country.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
State companies and companies with state participation preferred to lease Class B premises (74% of leased space in 2007-2016). Purchased premises distribution by class was more variable from year to year, though Class A has the share of 62% in the total purchased premises for the period of 2007-2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
State structures purchased 75% of sold premises (including the transfer of ownership in the repayment of financial liabilities) for the period 2015-2016 and become the major buyer of office real estate in Moscow market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Historically, offices of government departments and agencies were concentrated in the CBD as this is a prestigious location that meets both the requirements of good transport accessibility and a high level of infrastructure. However, in 2015-2016 Moscow City business centres attracted public sector interest, when 277,500 sq m of office space were taken up. The largest transactions were acquisition of Evolution Tower by Transneft, purchase of 55,000 sq m in OKO BC by Government of Moscow, and transfer of ownership of Eurasia Tower to VTB.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Geographical structure of public sector take-up&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/upload/medialibrary/e30/Government companies deal structure eng.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Government companies deal structure eng.jpg&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Government companies deal structure eng.jpg&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;700&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;496&amp;quot;  /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Government agencies&amp;rsquo; and organizations’ activity may affect the main indicators and the overall situation in the market. Thus, the demand for large offices reduces the amount of available supply of large premises, thereby decreasing vacancy. The bright example is the change of vacancy in Moscow City over the past two years, which has declined to 16% in the end of 2016 from 42.4% in the end of 2014. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP forecasts, in 2017 the public sector will continue to show active interest in Moscow office real estate, using remaining attractive terms of lease and purchase. The ambitious Rostech-City project on the territory of the Tushino airfield, Rostech-City, where the state corporation plans to consolidate its offices is оne of the examples that stimulates development activity.&#13;

Elena Denisova, Senior Director, Head of Offices, CORE.XP, Russia, comments: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Public sector organizations will vacate office premises in CBD, by relocating to more quality buildings. There are almost no new offices under construction in the centre of the city, and the current supply of large blocks (over 10 thousand sq m) of Class A in CBD is singular. Taking into account the large premises required for public sector organizations, they will be considering other office districts outside CBD, like Moscow City, West and South directions of Moscow.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Director, Head of Research, CORE.XP, Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Public sector organization, like any other companies, seek to obtain the most convenient and beneficial solution for their employees. However, such structures often have heterogeneous, established over many years, and large-scale real estate portfolios, which can include buildings in ownership, as well as multiple lease agreements. In this case, difficulties arise in effective management of the property portfolio. The process of optimizing office space is often complicated by the bureaucratic mechanisms within structures that slow down the decision-making process.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Russian chain of medical centres SM-Clinic leased 2,778.6 sq m free-standing office building on Simferopolskiy boulevard, 22 in Moscow. The lease agreement is signed for 10 years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The building is in &amp;ldquo;Shell &amp;amp;amp; Core&amp;rdquo; condition. Fit-out works will be performed by the clinics itself in accordance with the strict requirements for medical institutions. The new clinics will be opened for its clients in November 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elina Stepnaya, Associate Director, Offices Department, CORE.XP, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;We are delighted that the building we showed to &amp;amp;quot;SM&amp;ndash;Clinic&amp;amp;quot; for their new multidisciplinary medical center in the South of Moscow was ideal in terms of both: the location and the concept. It is difficult to find an office space in a free-standing building in the city today, which also meets all the technical requirements for the medical institutions.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investment volume in real estate in Russia amounted to $700 mn in Q1 2017 that is 66% lower than in respective period of 2016. This decline is explained by record high amount of deals in 1Q 2017 (due to closure of one large deal of office purchase by Transneft) which equalled 46% in total yearly investment transactions volume. If this deal is to be excluded, the volume will be down by 34% YoY in Q1 2017. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Foreign investment share increase to 22% in Q1 2017 from 5.4% in Q1 2016. Almost half (47%) of volume has been invested into retail real estate, demonstrating the start of investor interest into retail real estate. About 19% has been invested in residential development projects, 16% &amp;ndash; in offices, 17% – in hotels.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The average deal size was 54% lower in Q1 2017 and amounted to $41 mn vs $90 mn in Q1 2016. However, if Transneft deal is excluded, average deal size amounted to $50 mn in Q1 2017, similar to Q1 2017 average deal size.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Due to Leto shopping centre deal closure, the share of St. Petersburg&amp;rsquo;s investment volume increased to 35% in Q1 2017 from 11% in 2016. The share of Moscow accounted for 48% in Q1 2017. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investors still prefer standing assets, the share of which remained relatively stable, at the level of 81% in Q1 2017 vs 85% in 2016.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After key rate cut at the end of March and taking into account Bank of Russia rhetoric about further cuts in Q2-Q3 2017, cost of debt finance will continue to go down. On the back of this, real estate capitalization rate compression by year-end is also expected.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investment activity on the real estate market is increasing on the back of rouble and oil price stability, as well as Russian economy exiting recession. Investment volume in 2017 may overcome previous year result and amount to $5 bn. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High street vacancy rate decreased to 5.2% by the end of Q12017 compared to 6.3% in mid-2016. The highest volume of vacant space as usual offered on Tverskaya and Arbat, 35% and 17% are vacant respectively.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prime rental rates did not change significantly compared to 2016 and amounted to RUB230,000 per sq m/year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Generally the level of rental rate at different streets is stable and average rental rate amounted to RUB100,000 per sq m/year. Noteworthy, rental rates at Tverskaya street close to Okhotniy Ryad slightly increased, to RUB 100,000 from RUB 75,000 per sq m/year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There were no shopping centres delivered in Q1 2017 in Moscow. The same situation was seen in Q1 2016, when zero delivery was recorded in Moscow for the first time for the last decade. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lower retail real estate completions will lead to further decline of vacancy rate. The average vacancy rate may go down to 8.5% by end-2017.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The international retailer interest to Russian market is still high. This is facilitated by lower rental rates, rental payments based on a percentage of turnover and increased number of new sites for retailers&amp;rsquo; development for the last two years. Six new international brands entered Moscow retail market, which is comparable to the average quarterly figure in 2016. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;182,000 sq m was taken-up in Q1 2017. The indicator declined by 27% as compared to Q1 2016, but still stays at quite high level.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lease transaction continue to prevail in demand structure &amp;ndash; 94% of take-up. The most active sector was production companies of various types of goods (tires, household chemicals and home appliances) – 44% of all deals.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Rental rates grew by 6% entailed by stable demand activity, weighted average base rental rate amounted to RUB 3500/sq m/year getting back to 2016 mid-year level.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;141,000 sq m of new warehouse space was commissioned in Q1 2017. After quite high delivery volumes seen in Q3-Q4 2016 development activity returned to moderate level. The majority of buildings were intended to specific clients while share of speculative development amounted to a mere 30% of quarterly completions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vacancy rate grew by 1 ppt and reached 13.8%. Almost the same level was already observed in the Q1 2016. At the same time lack of large space is still taking place on the market – area of average vacant block does not exceed 20,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Forecast for 2017 remains unchanged: &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New supply is expected at level of 600,000 sq m. About 30% of it will be built for specific companies.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take-up is likely to reach 1 mn sq m and may even exceed this level.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The beginning of 2017, as well as the end of last year, was marked by a record low volume of completions. The new minimum is caused by the postponement of commissioning of many business centres, the construction of which is at high stage of readiness. In Q1 2017, Dubrovka Plaza and new reconstructed buildings in Bolshevik Phase I were commissioned, with a total rentable area of about 21,100 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Based on the plans of developers, Moscow office market should be replenished by 500,000 sq m of new supply in 2017. Half of this volume is expected for commissioning in the first half of the year. In Q2 2017, Neopolis Business District, Oasis, Fili Grad Phase II and others business centres are planned for delivery.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Office real estate market almost did not feel the seasonal decline in activity in Q1 2017. Take-up amounted to 239,000 sq m, which is 45% higher than the value in the same period last year and 66% higher than in Q1 2015.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2017, the volume of renewals and renegotiations dropped to its lowest level in the last two years. They have a 19% share in the structure of total leasing activity. Thus, normal proportion of new lease and purchase deals and renewal and renegotiation transactions was reached in Q1.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lease deals dominated in the structure of demand in January-March 2017. They form 97% of take-up. In this period 223,000 sq m were leased. At the same time, in Q1 both tenants and buyers give preference to Class B premises. This segment accounted to 69% of take-up.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Areas between TTR and MKAD and between GR (Garden Ring) and TTR were key zones in the territorial structure of take-up. The share of transactions in the zone between TTR and MKAD amounted to 41% (9 ppts higher than in Q1 2016) or 97,800 sq m of leased and purchased space. One of the largest deals in the zone is purchase of 4,500 sq m in class A SkyLight business centre by Locko-Bank. Office buildings located between the GR and TTK had 37% of take-up, which is 20 ppts higher than in Q1 2016. A large deal in this area was the purchase of office building at 1st Krasnogvardeyskiy proezd by Russian Agricultural Bank. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Overall vacancy rate slightly decreased from 15.9% at the end of last year to 15.8% in the Q1 2017. Vacancy in class A is amounted to 19%, which is 0.4 ppts above the value in Q4 2016. Share of vacant office space in class B segment on the contrary decreased by 0.2 ppts to 14.7%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The volume of vacant office space in Moscow City business centres is declining gradually. At the end of Q1 vacant office space is amounted to about 142,000 sq m, which is 10% less than the available area in Q1 2016 and 55% below the value in Q1 2015. The vacancy rate has changed from 16% in Q4 2016 to 15.6% in Q1 2017.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Rental rates for office space remained at the level of 2016 year end. Class A Prime asking rates are in the range of $750-850 per sq m per year. The average range of class A rates is RUB 18,000 &amp;ndash; 30,000 per sq m per year, class B rates – RUB 12,000 – 21,000 per sq m per year. All rates are excluding operating costs and VAT.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP’s annual study of global shopping centre development found that development activity of shopping centre space around the world remains heavily concentrated in the Asia Pacific region (APAC), which accounts for 26.6 million sq m of space, with construction activity focussed in more than 90% of the Asian cities surveyed compared to 56 cities in the Americas and 14% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
China remains the most active shopping centre market accounting for 19.7 million sq m of the development pipeline under construction and includes 15 cities in the top 20 most active development markets globally. Shenzhen takes the top spot for the most shopping space under construction with 4.5 million sq m, followed by Shanghai with 3 million sq m, together they account for 40% of China’s construction pipeline as of the end of 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) the development pipeline has started to slow down with the level of shopping centres under construction totalling 4.49 million sq m. Russia, Turkey and the UAE account for the majority of activity in EMEA with Turkish cities dominating the development pipeline with 1.3 million sq m of space under construction across 17 shopping centres. In the Middle East, Dubai is expected to strengthen its position as a leading retail destination as the market is set to see an increase in supply with 900,000 sq m of new retail space expected to be delivered over the next three years. Notable retail schemes include the Nakheel Mall on the Palm Jumeirah, the Circle Mall in Jumeirah Village Circle and ongoing expansion projects in existing shopping centres such as the Dubai Mall. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite a slowdown in shopping centre completions over the past few years, 2016 saw an increase of 11.4% globally compared to 2015. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Americas registered the strongest growth with shopping centre completion levels up 43.6% due mostly to a surge in construction in Mexico which saw 1.3 million sq m of space added across three major Mexican cities. EMEA shopping centre completions make up 16% of the global total and saw an increase of 18% year-on-year. Moscow and Istanbul are the only markets outside of Asia to feature in the top 10 cities of global shopping centre completions.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Natasha Patel, Director, EMEA Research, CORE.XP commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Although on the whole we are seeing a slowdown in shopping centre development activity, 2016 witnessed an increase in the amount of space coming on stream globally as centres in the pipeline finally came to market. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“However, leasing activity has proved challenging in many locations, as retailers navigate the retail landscape to find the perfect operational model which combines online and bricks and mortar. Some shopping centres have delayed opening or have opened with some vacant space. Going forward many investors and landlords are taking a more cautious approach as a number of markets are experiencing some level of saturation. The focus will be on repositioning and renovating existing assets and creating an experience for consumers in order to differentiate centres and drive footfall.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Dzuba, Head of Research CORE.XP, Russia:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;In 2016 nine new shopping centres with total leasable area of 473,000 sq m were delivered in Moscow, slightly (by 7.2%) exceeding the previous year’s results. Among the projects launched during 2016 the average vacancy dropped from 40% to 20%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The development cycle is over, and there are almost no projects that started before the crisis in Moscow. The total completions volume announced for 2017 amounts to 196,000 sq m in 5 shopping centres, which is the lowest figure in the last five years. The largest project of 2017 in Moscow will be Vegas Kuntsevo with 113,000 sq m of retail space. Another 8 shopping centres with almost 400,000 sq m rentable area are announced for delivery in 2018 and 2019. Ostrov Mechty (105,000 sq m GLA) and Salaris (110,000 sq m GLA) are the largest among them”.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;Notes to editor:&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  The survey was based on 168 cities globally and focused on centres over 20,000 sq m and excludes retail warehousing and factory outlet centres. The definition used in this analysis is set out in full in the back of this report. The ViewPoint provides a snapshot of the most active shopping centre markets globally and identifies the key development trends in these locations.&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  For the purposes of this analysis, shopping centres have been defined as purpose-built and centrally managed schemes with a gross lettable area of over 20,000 sq m. The analysis includes only new centres and major extensions (20,000 sq m and above) to existing schemes. Retail warehousing and factory outlet centres have been excluded. In Asia, the analysis includes retail shopping malls and standalone department stores over 20,000 sq m. It excludes department stores which lease space as tenants within larger shopping centres. In North America, the analysis included regional malls, community centre, lifestyle centres, and power centres and also includes all extensions to existing schemes (albeit there was very little new space under construction). Whilst every effort was made to provide data on a consistent basis there are some unavoidable differences by country and region.&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;&#13;

This is largely attributed to European retailers redirecting their focus on expansion in their home continent rather than in locations where currencies have become more expensive.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
	&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
On a city level, Hong Kong has retained its position as the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular destination for retailer expansion in 2016 attracting 87 new retailers, according to CORE.XP’s annual report &amp;lsquo;How Global is the Business of Retail?’. Hong Kong is closely followed by London which has witnessed the second highest presence of new retailer entrants, with a total of 65 international retailers opening stores in London for the first time in 2016. Retailers such as Nars, New Balance, and Dyson all opened new stores in London last year helping London to maintain its position as a global retail powerhouse. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
London is followed by Dubai who welcomed 59 new entrants. Doha moved up six places from last year’s new entrants ranking to take fourth place with 58 new retail brands and Tokyo being the fifth most sought after market with 48 new entrants to make up the top five most targeted retail cities globally. Notably, Paris has jumped to 8th place (from 20th last year) attracting 36 new retailers as the French capital continues to attract international retailers due to its strong tourism market and stable economy. 33% of the new retailers to Paris are specialist clothing retailers such as Jordan, Rip Curl and Athlete’s Foot who are all targeting the large number of Parisian millennials. Moscow and Vienna also featured in the top 10 target markets with 39 and 29 new entrants, respectively.&#13;

The latest CORE.XP report which tracks and identifies the target cities for international retailers in 2016 found that the majority of the new retail brands that have opened in London originate from the United States, demonstrating that London continues to be a magnet for international retailers who want to establish their brand before expanding into Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). 2016 also set a record for the amount of money invested in retail property in London with &amp;pound;2 billion being spent by the end of last year.&#13;

David Close, Senior Director, Cross Border Retail – EMEA, CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The current economic climate has led to retail brands targeting tried-and-tested retail locations. Retailers are increasingly looking at the traditional strongholds of London, Paris and Hong Kong and stores in the most prominent cities remain a strategic opportunity to attract consumers, build brand loyalty and generate sales off-line and on&amp;rdquo;.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP’s latest study found that international retailers targeted a wide range of new markets in 2016. Of the cities surveyed, 89% saw at least one new international brand. Retailer activity increased by 2% in 2016, a decline from 3.1% registered in the previous year, and indicating a slight slowdown in retailers’ global expansion plans. The vast majority of the top 15 cities targeted by retailers for the first time last year were mature markets with only one up-and-coming market, the Croatian city of Split, ranked among the top destinations for expanding retailers last year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Natasha Patel, Director, EMEA Research, CORE.XP, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Global expansion has started to slow as retailers consider the right mix of bricks and clicks, and are more strategic about their physical store networks. As in previous years, U.S retailers continued to be the most active in their expansion. However, significant industry and macroeconomic challenges remain for retailers and may force some brands to be more cautious in their expansion plans.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Globally, the report revealed that coffee shops and restaurants to be the hottest retail sector for expansion into new markets, with retailers in that category accounting for 22% of all expansion at city level. Next in line was specialist clothing stores (18%) and mid-range fashion stores (17%).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the economic uncertainty in Russia, a number of global retailers are actively entering and expanding their chains both in Moscow and regions. With 39 new international brands in the Moscow market in 2016, the city is among top ten target destinations for global retailers. The majority of these brands entered the market via local partners but nine brands entered the market directly which is 30% above average and reflects well on the increasing transparency of Russian business in general. New retailers include Rolex, Laduree, Superdry, Victoria’s Secret, Urban Decay, Wycon, Charlotte Olympia with fashion, cosmetics and F&amp;amp;amp;B accounting for about 70% of new entries. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Magomed Akhkuev, Analyst, Research Department of CORE.XP in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Factors encouraging international retailer to enter Moscow include giant population of over 12 mln people (2nd in Europe after Istanbul), massive retail sales volume (over 70 billion dollars) and a bigger negotiating power. The latter includes lower dollar-denominated rental rates as a result of Ruble depreciation, switching to turnover-based rents, opportunity to get a refund on capital expenditures to some fashion operators. Another important reason is the increased number of new sites for retailers’ development as the end of development cycle in 2014-2016 resulted in a huge volume of new quality retail space delivered in Moscow (1.6 mln sq m.).” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the past 12 months, &amp;euro;12.2 bln was invested by investors into core-CEE markets, reaching a new peak for the four rolling quarters.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Momentum is expected to continue in 2017 as investors perceive the CEE region as an investment market offering strong economic fundamentals and an attractive yield gap to Western European markets. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The full year 2017 is expected to exceed the record investment volume of €11.3 bln in 2016 with all core - CEE countries expected to perform strongly. The 2007 peak stood at €9.8 bln.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anthony Selman, Head of CEE Investment Properties, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The unprecedented volume of capital targeting CEE is a testament to the strong economic fundamentals and growth of the region. As competition for prime assets heats up we expect investors to be more aggressive on secondary property in the core markets while taking another serious look at markets offering a greater yield advantage such as Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Russia will also benefit as the economy stabilizes and risk is out of the currency.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Core-CEE investment volume has been historically driven by the Czech Republic and Poland, which together account for app 75% of total volume on average. However, in the past two quarters the Czech Republic became the market with the highest investment volume in CEE. In Q1 2017, over EUR 1.4 bln was invested into commercial real estate in the Czech Republic accounting for more than half of total investment volume within the core-CEE markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As most uncertainty is now out of the Polish market core money is finding its way back and Poland is expected to have a strong second half of the year following a slow start.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Investors have found their way back to the Hungarian market in a big way with almost EUR 500mln transacted in Q1 2017. The full year of 2017 is expected to be the strongest year ever. Yields will continue to compress across sectors making it the market with the most significant yield movement.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Slovak market is on the radar of investors looking for yield as competition for assets is becoming fiercer in the Czech Republic.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
After two quarters of dominance of investment in the office sector, the most attractive asset type in Q1 2017 proved to be the retail sector accounting for almost €1.4 billion in total – with a multitude of prime assets trading. Retail is expected to be the most popular asset class for the full year of 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
So far in 2017, In the Czech Republic, prime yields have compressed for offices, shopping centres and high-street retail. In Hungary, prime yields dropped for offices and shopping centres. Further yield compression is expected in Hungary and Slovakia while prime yields remained stable in most other markets. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Just like CEE countries Russia has demonstrated positive investment trends in the last couple of years. Given positive market activity in Russia, decrease in the key rate and active interest from investors, we expect that the total investment volume in 2017 will hit over $5 bln, demonstrating a 10% growth YOY. Whilst certain CEE countries have reached their record high investment volume, Russia is only starting to unveil its path to recovery.” &#13;

SIBUR's products will be delivered from its production sites in dry bulk containers, a transportation method unique in Russia and more efficient compared to the conventional transportation in pallets, as it allows to transport more cargo and cut packaging costs. This will help optimise logistics by moving part of packaging operations from Tobolsk to the region of destination. SIBUR will use the hub to ship its products to the Central Federal District, while also considering the development of the rail transit corridor to East Europe. Container trains will arrive at the Freight Village Vorsino's rail terminal. Comprehensive hub-related services will be provided to SIBUR by KSS. &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In EMEA, Durban (South Africa) had the highest increase in occupancy cost overall, though Stockholm (Sweden) registered some of the fastest growth in Europe. Palma de Mallorca (Spain), Belfast (U.K.) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) also showed double-digit growth, with Lyon (France) and Berlin (Germany) not far behind.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In London’s West End, the fall in occupancy costs is largely due to a fall in rents triggered by more subdued demand, particularly amongst financial occupiers who have become less willing to pay the high rents prevailing in London’s premier market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Occupier efforts to reduce occupancy costs due to the ongoing strength of the Swiss franc relative to the euro have resulted in falls in Swiss markets, including Geneva and Zurich.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;London (City) was pushed out of the top-10 most expensive markets to 11th place, despite&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;prime office costs rising by 2.9%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Irina Khoroshilova, Director, Head of Occupier Services CORE.XP in Russia said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;“In global ranking of cities as of Q1 2017, Moscow ranked 12th by prime office occupancy costs per square meter (which includes all tenant's payments). Moscow is consistently ranked among the most expensive cities, placed 11th last year. However, this analysis reflects the upper price boundary for the offered office space in Moscow located in the premium locations. The average asking rental rates in Class A Prime segment is currently range $ 750-850 per sq m p.a. excluding operational expenses and VAT. The average operational expenses in Class A Prime amount to $120-130 per sq m p.a.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In Singapore, occupancy costs continued to fall, thanks to increased supply of office stock and weak levels of inflation.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most expensive market in the global ranking from the Pacific Region was Sydney (US$97 per sq. ft.), in 19th place. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the Americas, suburban Denver, suburban Houston and New York Midtown South saw the largest occupancy-cost increases in the U.S., but Buenos Aires showed the biggest increase in the Americas overall.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
So far this deal is the largest warehouse lease in 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The warehouse will be used by Pyaterochka retail chain during 10 years. The owner of the premises, Logopark Development is working on the implementation of multi-temperature warehousing solutions (build-to-suit scheme) in accordance with the technical specifications of the tenant.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Logopark Sever 2 is a modern class A warehouse complex with the total area of 270,000 sq m. The complex is located near Litvinovo village in Solnechnogorsky district of Moscow region, in close proximity to the main logistic routes: New Leningradskoye higway, Leningradskoye highway (7 km), A-107 &amp;amp;quot;Betonka&amp;amp;quot;, Rogachevskoye highway.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The deal with X5 Retail Group is the third deal of CORE.XP in this logistics park. The two lease agreements for a multi-temperature warehouses with the largest food retailer O'KEY (60,000 sq m) and DIY retailer OBI (35,000 sq m) were signed in this warehouse in 2016. Both deals were nominated for CRE Moscow Awards 2017 and O'KEY transaction won in the nomination &amp;amp;quot;Deal of the Year. Warehouse real estate.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;X5 Retail Group continues its active development, choosing the best logistics solutions. The company has chosen &amp;amp;quot;Logopark Sever -2&amp;amp;quot;, because this logistics park really meets all the qualities of a Class A+ warehouse complex.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to the report, the volume of quality office market outside the MKAD is approximately 1.3 million sq m, 32% of which is Class A offices. In addition to that over 57% of the total office supply in this segment is located outside of the Moscow Ring Road and is concentrated in business centers of New Moscow.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The volume of office real estate market of New Moscow increased by almost two times and reached 472 200 sq. m. from 2014 to the second half of 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Elena Denisova, Senior Director, Head of Offices, CORE.XP Russia said: &amp;ldquo;The office market of New Moscow is underestimated. In the return of centralization and rental rates reduction in the central part of the city, tenants are aiming to have offices inside the Third Ring Road, basically not realizing all the benefits that New Moscow if offering.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite rental levels remaining stable quarter on quarter on New Bond Street, the UK’s capital has also ranked second among the world’s top 10 most expensive retail locations ($1,753 per sq ft per year in Q1 2017) with New York’s Fifth Avenue retaining its position as the world’s most expensive retail destination commanding $3,240 per sq ft per year. Hong Kong, Paris and Tokyo make up the top five markets for prime retail rents.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report which is based on the retail rent per square foot that retailers have to pay every year to occupy a shop in a prime location shows that Europe was the only region to register rental growth in Q1 2017 with an increase of 4.3% year-on-year.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Many of Western Europe’s capital cities witnessed strong rental growth which is being driven by lack of supply in prime retail areas. This has led to retailers paying higher rents in these cities to guarantee brand awareness and further support their expansion plans within the region. The return of prosperity to the Irish and Spanish economies has also led to Dublin and Madrid registering rental growth of 10.5% and 6.4% respectively, in the past year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
St. Petersburg ranked second in the top 10 fastest growing retail locations and reported a 15.4% year-on-year growth; this was largely driven by an increase in tourism in the city. Retailers have shown strong demand for prime retail locations and similar to the growing trend in the wider retail industry, demand by Food &amp;amp;amp; Beverage operators looking to enter markets has pushed the growth in rents. Auckland and Sofia were third with 12.5%, Dublin was fifth with 10.5% and Glasgow was sixth with 9.4%.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Rhodri Davies, Head of UK Retail, CORE.XP, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;London’s overall performance is emblematic of the broad strength we are seeing across the retail market in Europe. Demand for quality retail space in London remains robust and the arrival of brands such as New Balance, and Nars has further underlined the importance of these prime shopping destinations.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
However, an increase in occupational costs, as a result of business rates revaluation, has meant that retailers are increasingly being more selective about their choice of store location. This has resulted in a slowdown in the past six months of retailers transactions in London’s prime retail streets&amp;rdquo;.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Natasha Patel, EMEA Retail Research at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The retail sector is rapidly evolving and is a highly competitive market, therefore, retail brands must focus on targeting consumers across multiple channels. The physical store remains an important part of the consumer journey and retailers will continue to target prime bricks-and-mortar locations to grow their brand. Stores will also become the place that customers use to interact with physical products and retailers will use to showcase and try innovative technology”.&#13;

Marina Malakhatko, Director, Head of Moscow Retail, CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Prime rental rate on Moscow’s most expensive street – Stoleshnikov Lane – is now around 300 000 RUB/sq m/year which corresponds to 465 US$ /sq ft/year. In general, Moscow street retail market has been very unstable over the past two years. A massive street renovation programme that is currently in progress has negatively affected both pedestrian and automobile traffic hence lowering rental rates. At the same time new international retailers are now more interested in shopping centres rather than street retail: out of 23 new brands in H1 2017, only 5 preferred street retail as the point of entry to the market.” </value></field><field name="DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="CODE"><value>retail_rental_rates_emea</value></field><field name="TAGS"/><field name="XML_ID"><value>2359</value></field><field name="IBLOCK_SECTION"/><property name="P_DIR"><value>412</value></property><property name="P_COUNTRY"><value>419</value><value>418</value></property><property name="P_FILE"/></item><item><field name="ACTIVE"><value>Y</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_FROM"><value>27.07.2017 18:49:00</value></field><field name="ACTIVE_TO"/><field name="SORT"><value>500</value></field><field name="NAME"><value>European Investment Booms with 25% Year on Year Increase</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_PICTURE"/><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT"><value>&#13;

This brings total investment in real estate in H1 2017 to €130bn, a 13% increase on H1 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The strong quarterly performance was, in large part, driven by an upturn in UK trading activity with volumes reaching €23.4bn in Q2 2017, up from €16bn in Q1 2017, and a 54% increase on the same period last year. The sale of Logicor in Q2 did have substantial UK exposure but even if this large transaction were to be excluded, investment volumes would still be trending up year on year, as market activity continues to recover from the slowdown immediately preceding and following last year&amp;rsquo;s European Union referendum.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Germany once again proved to be the driving force behind investment growth in Continental Europe which, as a region, posted 15% growth on the same period last year. In Germany, transaction levels for H1 2017 increased by 49% compared to H1 2016, transacting €13.9bn in Q2 2017 and €26.5 for the first half of 2017. The Southern European markets of Italy and Spain, as well as the Netherlands, also witnessed strong investment growth over the quarter, posting 110%, 76% and 38% increases respectively. In France, the results for the first half of 2017 were somewhat muted; however, the election of Macron in May will likely have a positive impact on occupier and investor sentiment, and the investment pipeline has strengthened going into H2 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Q2 2017 was driven by robust growth in the industrial and logistics sector and, to a lesser degree, the alternative sector, as investors look to diversify their asset base. The industrial sector witnessed a 303% increase on the same period last year (which can in part be attributed to the sale of the Logicor portfolio) whilst the alternatives sector posted a 20% increase. Meanwhile, office transactions across Europe in Q2 2017 were down 6% on Q2 2016.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;After a relatively slow start to the year, the UK has seen a significant recovery in investment volumes in Q2 2017. Despite ongoing political uncertainties, the UK remains a pre-eminent market, attracting significant European and global capital. In addition, the Continental European markets continued to perform strongly in the second quarter of 2017 with Germany once again proving a major focus for capital and demonstrating its status as a safe haven for global wealth. “&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Growing confidence in the recovery markets of Spain and Italy has come to the fore this quarter as investors seek to allocate capital to these markets,&amp;rdquo; - Hull added. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

“In Q2 2017, the volume of investment in the Russian real estate market reached $0.9 bn (€0.8 bn), which is twice as much as in the same period last year. Meanwhile, in the first half of 2017, the volume of investment amounted to $1.6 bn (€1.48 bn), which is 36% lower than the total volume of investment in the first half of 2016 ($2.5 bn or €2.3 bn) that was largely driven by one single transaction with the state involvement. One of the main trends observed in early 2017 was significant increase in the share of foreign investment deals in the Russian real estate market that risen from 4,6% in H1 2016 to 34% in H1 2017 (15% were transacted by the global companies, 11% - by Asian, 8% - by European). Also, we observed an increase in investors’ interest in the retail segment, investment in which reached 32% in the first half of 2017, relative to 3% in the first half of 2016. Foreign investors activity indicates the gradual recovery of the market and the potential for investment volumes to reach $5 bn (€4.6 bn), by the end of 2017.”&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to the report, total transactions volume amounted to 311,000 sq m, exceeding its Q1 level by 71%. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Total demand for H1 2017 grew by 21% compared to H1 2016 and added up to 493,000 sq, which could be explained by economic activity recovery, attributable to the overall market conditions improvement.&#13;

So far X5 Retail Group deal is the largest warehouse lease in 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
71,000 sq m was commissioned in Q2. Over the last few months construction activity remained relatively low. The majority of new supply represents next construction phases of existing warehouse complexes. H1 2017 construction declined to 75 % of its H1 2016 level, reaching 212,000 sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Vacancy rate reduced by 1,2 p.p. in Q2 2017 compared to Q1. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Forecasted annual take-up is expected at 1 mn sq m. The demand will continue to focus on vacant space. Based on low volumes of speculative development, volume of a vacant space will decrease to 12% and will allow keeping the rental rates unchanged. In the meantime, their range may narrow down to upper limit due to exit of cheaper space from the market.&#13;

Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;We observe a significant improvement on the industrial real estate market. The vacancy dynamics has stabilized, vacant space volume remained unchanged since 2016. Downward trend in prices has stopped, rental rates are fairly stable. We expect certainty and optimism in future market development. This is already reflected in both growing leasable spaces of current agreements and transactions planned for the second half of the year. Industrial real estate market is gaining pace.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

A drop in vacancy level caused by zero delivery in H1 2017 is observed in both older projects and those delivered amidst the crisis in 2014-2016. The average vacancy level in shopping centres of 2014-15 decreased from 27% to 13% over the last two years, and in projects delivered in 2016 &amp;ndash; from 38% to 17% over the last 12 months. &#13;

&amp;ldquo;Bad weather affected performance of fashion retailers in the first half of the year. They didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sell summer collections before the start of sales in June and July, which is why the majority of retailers had to reconsider their development plans. Rental rates still very much depend on a quality of a project, so they technically increase due to low delivery volume.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Vacancy rate decrease due to low new delivery volume and stabilized demand both in Class A and B has become the key trend in H1 2017. Meanwhile the lack of new buildings is deteriorating the collapse gradually formed on the market in a 2-3 years perspective, that will seriously affect medium and large-scale business. Current demand is still limited, whilst companies&amp;rsquo; activity follows the recovery trend if compared to the preceding year. This activity conversion into the transactions in H2 or its failure will determine potential rental rates growth.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Moscow, 8 August 2017, - The share of foreign investments into Russian real estate increased from 4.6% in the H1 2016 to 34% in the same period of 2017, according to the latest data from global real estate advisor, CORE.XP. At the same time, the share of Asian companies was 11% in the structure of the total volume of investments that is historically the highest for Russian market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In the H1 2017 $1.6 billion was invested into Russian real estate, which is 36% lower compared to the same period last year ($2.5 billion) and 15% higher than the amount invested in the first six months 2015 ($1.4 billion). However, excluding the largest Q1 2017 purchase transaction with governmental company which bought an office building in MIBC Moscow-City, that has formed 40% of H1 2017 transaction volume, H1 2017 increase on previous year is only 6%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The most attractive for investors in H1 2017 were office and retail real estate segments, which accounted for 34% and 32% respectively. The retail real estate segment significantly increased its share in the investment structure in the H1 2017, increasing by 30 ppts. compared with the value of the H2 2016 (2.5%) and for 15 ppts. compared with the value for the entire 2016. The key deals were the sale of Vozdvizhenka Center and Legion II, as well as the two shopping centres: Leto (saint-Petersburg) and Gorbushkin Dvior in Moscow.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;An average deal size decreased by 36% in H1 2017 and amounted to $38 million against $60 million in H1 2016.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Central Bank policy on key rate decrease (in H1 2017 the rate has decreased from 10% to 9%) has influenced the cost of loan financing. Based on this further real estate capitalization rates compression is possible by the year-end. In H1 capitalization rates has experienced a slight decrease to the level of 9.75% for offices. 10.00% for retail and 12.50 for quality warehouse assets. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Against the background of the Russian ruble and oil prices stability, as well as the economy's exit from the recession, investment activity in the real estate market is increasing. As a result, the volume of investments in 2017 can surpass the result of 2016 and amount to about $5 billion.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;The most important event in H1 2017 is the decline in capitalization rates in all segments of commercial real estate. This is the first time since 2014. We expect that this compression will be a positive signal for investors and potential buyers&amp;rsquo; interest will be converted into deals by the end of the year. Thus, large transactions with foreign capital were closed in the first half of this year, and further stabilization of the market will at least maintain the share of foreign investments in the total volume of transactions.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;

Apart from traditional chain restaurants two new restaurants were opened in August. These are a fish restaurant Fish Market (260 sq m) and a Russian restaurant Po-Russki (260 sq m).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Evgenia Prilutskaya, Senior Consultant, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;amp;quot;The recent trends show that shopping malls are becoming more like a place for family entertainment rather than just a traditional place for shopping. As noted in our research 25% of the customers who come to malls for shopping, stop at restaurants in the end. Taking into account this factor, our company formed a pool of tenants for the restaurant zone, which is now represented not only by fast-food operators, but also by full-scale restaurants.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New construction shrank to its minimum level over the last few years.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest construction levels were seen in Yekaterinburg, Perm, Artyom, where 30,000 sq m (DC X5 Retail Group), 25,000 sq m (PLK Yankovsky) and 24,000 sq m (DC X5 Retail Group) were delivered accordingly.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Distribution centers of large federal retailers represent 46% of new supply.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Amid the decline in new delivery, take-up increased by 23% compared to H2 2016. Most transactions in H1 2017 are lease agreements. More than 40% of demand represents 20,000 sq m buildings and larger space. The biggest take-up was seen in Yekaterinburg, Samara and Kaluga.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
9 Russian regional markets were characterized by large (20&amp;rsquo;000 sq m +) warehouse spaces deficit.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the deficit in the vacant warehouse space, rental rates are stable and demonstrate a moderate growth on specific markets.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia, comments: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;We face a significant deficit of large warehouse spaces in key logistic real estate markets. It is mostly due to low speculative development levels observed over the last several years. At the same time, big federal companies form a consistent market demand on large warehouse spaces. We expect new interesting projects, both speculative and built-to-suit&amp;rdquo;. &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This would be the first family adventure park in the northern part of Moscow Region. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Zamania park will represent the story of a &amp;amp;quot;Planet of robots&amp;amp;quot;, where visitors could get acquainted with robots from different eras and areas (transformers, the autobots, androids, steampunk robots, and so on). The park will satisfy the tastes of children and adults. It will be equipped with the rides, labyrinths, trampolines, tubing, trail on stilts and jumping pillow, trolley (bungee jumping), a real volcano, colorful chains and a few unique game elements, such as a giant robot head. A family caf&amp;eacute; with unique zone where Robo-pizza will be cooked will be opened in the park as well. For those who want to celebrate their birthday, there will be a banquet area, decorated in the style of Robo-city.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The grand opening of family adventure park Zamania is scheduled for the end of 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Alexandra Chirkaeva, Head of Moscow Retail Leasing , Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The entertainment segment is actively developing. There are more and more new formats opening every day &amp;ndash; the choice is now much wider, and the existing players are constantly improving.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A distinctive feature of Zamania adventure parks is that they are especially designed for each shopping centre and their theme concepts do not repeat each other.&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  ZELENOPARK has already established itself as a family shopping centre, and with another large-scale amusement park in addition to the existing Kidburg, Panda Park and a full-length Segway ride it will become of the best parks with entertainment part for children in the northern suburbs of Moscow.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The first lifestyle MODI store will be opened in autumn on the first floor of the Shopping Complex ATRIUM on the area of 168 sq. m. It is planned that the new retail chain will consist of over 200 stores by 2020. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Evgenia Prilutskaya, Senior Consultant, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;amp;quot;Flying Tiger Copenhagen retail chain is widely known in Europe, but in Russia, this niche was not occupied for a long time: there are many shops with very traditional souvenirs and gifts (such as, for example, Red Cube), as well as home products and accessories (Williams&amp;amp;amp;Oliver). MODI sells gifts more for yourself rather, than for others &amp;ndash; the funny and unusual things for your house, sports, study, leisure and everyday life that make you smile and buy something, that at first seems quite useless. This proves their concept of &amp;amp;quot;emotional shopping&amp;amp;quot;. With the features of the concept focused on impulse demand, MODI store in the Shopping and entertainment Complex ATRIUM is ideally located on the flow to the movie theater and the new food court.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

In this deal CORE.XP represented the owner of this shopping centre, Gorn Development, Ltd. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The new family restaurant with a playful concept and title Baron de Makaron was opened in mid- August on the second floor of the shopping complex Schuka on the area of 320 sq. m. The chef of this new restaurant, young and talented Ivan Rumyantsev, is a disciple of William Lamberti and Salvatore Bianco. The young chef is familiar to the Moscow public by work in such projects as United Kitchen, Joys Bar and Monster Hills.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This restaurant concept complements the existing strong pool of restaurants in Schuka complex. The shopping mall is located near the centre of Moscow in immediate proximity from metro station &amp;amp;quot;Schukinskaya&amp;amp;quot; with the direct access to the main highways, overlooking the MKAD, in a highly populated area of the city, where over 500 thousand people live. 50,000 visitors come to Schuka shopping complex every day.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Alexandra Chirkaeva, Head of Moscow Retail Leasing, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;ldquo;The area, where shopping complex Schuka is located, is characterized by a large amount of residential complexes. In addition, historically, Schuka is a kind of transport hub for many residents from neighboring districts. Given the low competitive supply in the area, the choice of the shopping center for a family restaurant is perfect. It's great that another concept of a family club-restaurant is opened, which will allow adults to have a quiet dinner and talk over a cocktail, not catching the kid between the tables.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 PandaPark in MEGAMAG Rostov-on-Don will be the largest indoor entertainment area. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The main feature of the park will be the rope route entering the shopping-centre&amp;rsquo;s atrium at the height of over 20 meters. There will be 9 rope routes in total for all age groups. Routes will vary in height and difficulty level. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The project is located in close proximity to the central part of the city and is being delivered in three phases which will total 110,000 sq m. The first phase was opened in December 2009 and includes a grocery hypermarket AUCHAN, Decathlon, M. video and over 100 stores. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The second phase of MEGAMAG will be opened in Q4 2017. The distinctive features of the second phase will be renewed external and internal premises of the shopping centre, developed by Chapman Taylor, international architectural bureau, improved tenant-mix and large entertainment component. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Anastasia Makarova, Consultant, Retail Department CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Shopping malls cease to be just a place for shopping, and become a place of social interaction. The landlords are growing the entertainment component, as well as food and drink area, including fast food and full format restaurant concept. While working on this projects we aimed not just to create another shopping centre in Rostov-on-Don, but to develop a unique project with quality entertainment component. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 PandaPark attracted us by their creative and brave ideas. We were able to use all floor area, including the atrium of the shopping centre with high rope trails for the most extreme visitors. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 MEGAMAG will be the first project in Rostov-on-Don, where a large scale entertainment component will be implemented.&amp;amp;quot; &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
New multifunctional complex (gross area 310,000 sq m, leasable &amp;ndash; 105,000 sq m) is located on Kievskoye shosse, 3 km from MKAD. The uniqueness of the project is its integration into the biggest transport interchange hub in Moscow, which will combine MFC and a bus station with the capacity of up to 250 buses in rush hours. There also will be a direct exit from metro station Salarievo to the MFC&amp;rsquo;s gallery. The catchment area of the project is 3.5 mln people. The major anchor operator of Salaris is Globus (26,524 sq m), first hypermarket of this chain to open in MFC in its new format Globus 3.0.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Marina Malakhatko, Head of Retail department in Moscow: &amp;laquo;New Moscow today is a rapidly developing area with an annual population growth of 100,000 people a year. Currently, there is already a city permission to build more than 9 mln sq m of residential housing. By 2019 there will be 37 new residential clusters there, and less than in 500 meters there is Salarievo Park, one of the biggest residential developments with a total area of around 1.5 mln sq m. Salaris retail area penetration is only 325 sqm per 1,000 inhabitants, herewith, there is still no comparable project neither by size nor concept’s quality on Kievskoye shosse. Due to obvious advantages of MFC and considering low levels of supply of new big retail schemes in the south of Moscow, we see a great interest from tenants to Salaris.&#13;

According to the report, 363,000 sq m was taken-up in Q3 2017, exceeding its previous quarter value by 16.7%. For the first time in 4 years purchase deals prevailed in take-up structure (general contract and BTS construction), accounting for 59% of demand. Only 39% of all transactions are lease agreements. Developers tend to expand their business beyond existing logistics parks and consider new business opportunities, including acting as general contractors to build warehouses facilities on land plots owned by end-users.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Largest deals in I&amp;amp;amp;L segment in Q3 2017:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A Plus Development will build a distribution center with total area of 146,000 sq m for Wildberries as a general contractor;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developer Orientir and online food retailer Utkonos signed a contract to build 69,000 sq m warehouse in logistic park Orientir Sever; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Major pharmaceutical distributor leased 15,000 sq m in Orientir Sever 2 warehouse complex, project developer is Orientir. Consultant of the deal was CORE.XP.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Q3 demand was mainly driven by business activity of e-commerce companies. Clothes and footwear as well as FMCG goods prevailed in take-up structure by goods type.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Total transactions in 2017 can reach 1.1 mn sq m, exceeding its 2016 value and annual completion volume in 2017 is expected at 600,000 sq m.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Anton Alyabyev, Director, Head of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;Despite high vacancy level in Moscow Region warehouse market, we observe deficit in large vacant spaces. Thus, a significant demand growth in Q3 is mainly attributable to big built-to-suit construction agreements. In this context, there is a growing interest for speculative development, and several new ambitious projects were announced. Besides, developers become more flexible, providing the client with an opportunity to build warehouse facilities as general contractors on land plot owned by end-users.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;We are pleased to produce another quarter of excellent results, with double-digit revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share up 28%,&amp;rdquo; said Bob Sulentic, CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s president and chief executive officer. “Our performance is the direct result of our focused strategy to produce exceptional outcomes for our clients and the commitment of our more than 75,000 people to executing our strategy.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The strength of our performance in the third quarter was broad-based. Each of our three global regions produced solid organic growth. Leasing returned to double-digit growth, and was especially strong in the U.S. Revenue growth accelerated in our occupier outsourcing business, as we continue to capitalize on our commanding position in this growing sector. Global property sales saw healthy growth, despite a generally tepid market for transaction activity, reflecting the strength of our brand and ability to take market share. Finally, we also had excellent performance in both of our real estate investment businesses.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mr. Sulentic added: “We continue to see healthy momentum across most of our businesses and regions and are increasing our full-year 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.58 to $2.68.” &#13;

The company leased 1,169 sq m office premises in K2 Business Park, located in Sosenskoe village, in 23 km on Kaluzhskoye highway, 14, building 3 in New Moscow. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

Nelt-Retail will occupy part of the 4th floor in building A in the beginning of December.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP reports the growing interest of companies to business centres located outside of Moscow. According to the recent survey of CORE.XP, vacancy in business centers outside the MKAD decreased to 20.6% from 22.8% by the end of Q3 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anastasia Fedorova, Property Advisor, Offices Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;amp;quot;It was quite important to find premises that meet all the requirements of Nelt-Retail for accommodation of their brand new office. K2 Business Park offers high quality fitted-out premises, extensive parking and attractive commercial terms for the tenant. The proximity of the Business Park to the MKAD, Profsoyuznaya street and Leninsky Avenue guarantees Nelt-Retail employees convenient access to both centre of Moscow as well as to Moscow Region. Olkhovskaya new metro station, which is planned to be opened in 2018 within walking distance from K2 Business Park, was an addition to the decision-making process to the new office location.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 9 November 2017 &amp;ndash; Total real estate investment in Europe reached &amp;euro;66bn in Q3 2017, representing a 12% increase on the same period last year, according to the latest report from global real estate advisor, CORE.XP. This brings 2017 year-to-date European real estate investment volumes to €196.5bn. Investment volumes for the last 12 months reached €288bn, a 14% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 The increase in Europe is supported by continued growth in the UK, driven by several high-profile office transactions, including the sale of 20 Fenchurch Street (commonly known as the Walkie Talkie) for &amp;pound;1.28bn. UK investment volumes reached €18.4b in Q3 2017, up 49% on the same period last year, which was impacted by the referendum. Transaction volumes in Germany also remained robust, although growth eased in comparison to previous quarters. However, investment volumes for the last 12 months were up 19% on the previous 12 months. Italy, Spain and the Netherlands also all posted strong growth in comparison to the previous 12 months. In France, investment turnover was below Q3 in 2016, but market sentiment is increasingly positive. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Robust growth in the industrial and logistics sector once again characterized the market in Q3 2017, with investment volumes up 14% on Q3 2016 and 73% on the preceding 12 months. Alternatives and hotels also performed strongly but it was offices that represented the largest proportion of the market, with €32.6bn worth of office transactions in Q3 2017, up 50% on Q3 2016. Office transactions for the last 12 months reached €120.2bn, representing a 12% increase on the same period in the previous year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;Investment volumes in Europe remain at elevated levels driven by strong growth in the UK. The UK market continues to recover from the impact of the referendum and the devaluation of sterling continues to attract significant European and global capital. UK growth is supported by high levels of overseas investment, particularly in London, which has resulted in several exceptionally large office and logistics transactions. The core markets of Germany, France and the Netherlands have maintained momentum in Q3 and we expect a strong final quarter. Economic recovery in the Southern European markets is reflected in the local property markets, which continue to attract capital. Transaction volumes in the last 12 months in both Spain and Italy out-performed the preceding 12-month period.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 “Russian investment volume has reached €2.2bn ($2.5bn) in Q1-Q3 2017, with a number of transactions expected to close in Q4 we anticipate YoY results to demonstrate marginal growth. Overseas investments recorded a 4.8 times increase in comparison to the previous year or a total of €485mln ($562mn) in Q1-Q3 comprising Western and Asian capital 70% and 30% respectively. Improved economy trends, such as 175 bps compression of the key rate (currently at 8.25%) since the beginning of the year, translate to an increasingly positive sentiment in the market. Whilst some investors are still waiting for continued market stabilization, others have faith in market recovery, hence a tangible increase in institutional arm&amp;rsquo;s length transactions in 2017.” &#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Turkey, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia are the most active countries in terms of shopping centre development and accounted for more than 50% of total development under construction in 2017. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Turkey saw 300,000 sq m of new space completed in the first half of the year and continues to have the largest shopping centre development pipeline in H1 2017 with 2.2 million sq m of new space under construction.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UAE follows closely behind with just under 2 million sq m of space currently under construction with Dubai accounting for more than three quarters of developments in the country. New schemes coming onto the market are trying to differentiate by providing amenities and experiences that are difficult to replicate online. One notable new scheme doing this is Meydan One Mall, which will include more than 100 food and beverage outlets, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest indoor ski slope and a luxury brand quarter. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Across Europe, the Eastern European countries are the most active shopping centre development markets, with Russia, Poland and Ukraine all showing strong development pipelines. Russia’s development pipeline currently stands at 1.9 million sq m and this is largely due to improving macroeconomics fundamentals coupled with strong forecasted retail sales which is starting to improve developer sentiment.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The UK has the largest shopping centre development pipeline in Western Europe with a total of 460,000 sq m of new space under construction and due be delivered over the next five years. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
France has the second largest shopping centre pipeline with 409,000 sq m and Spain is slightly behind with 345,000 sq m. Spain’s economic recovery is improving asset performance and investor and developer sentiment.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Extensions to existing shopping centres continue to be a popular route to achieving additional floor space, especially in Western European markets. Extensions made up 20% of shopping centre stock in EMEA with the UK, Ireland and Austria all showing sizable extension pipelines. The UK has one of the largest shopping centre extension pipelines in Europe with Westfield London making up 69,000 sq m. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of UK &amp;amp;amp; EMEA Retail Research, CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;The level of shopping centres under construction remains closely correlated to forecasted retail sales. Unsurprisingly, markets that are forecasted to have strong retail sales are particularly attractive to developers as retailers and occupancy are reliant on tapping into these markets for continued growth.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lsquo;Shopping centre extensions are increasingly driving the increase in the amount of construction levels and provide further evidence that well-placed schemes are willing to adapt to the structural shift at play in the retail market and counter the greater e-commerce adoption by providing more space for experience led retail.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vasiliy Grigoriev, Associate Director, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“After significant downturn in completions this year we expect market recovery in terms of supply. About 700,000 sq m to be delivered to the market in 2-3 years – mostly large shopping centers. Then we will likely to see structural changes in supply, from big projects to smaller buildings.”&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Big Data and enabled technology is fundamental to drive growth of the retail sector&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New CORE.XP insight assesses the future of retail in 2030&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 </value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 15 November 2017, &amp;ndash; Automation, customisation and big data are some of the trends expected to change the retail industry and the way consumers shop in the future. CORE.XP, the world&amp;rsquo;s leading real estate services firm, today revealed a series of insights for the retail landscape in 2030.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Future of Retail | 2030 examines 40 &amp;ldquo;futurist&amp;rdquo; insights and perspectives on how the world of retail will look different in the future - fuelled by changes in people’s lifestyles, urban environments, retail operations, logistics and other trends impacting the industry. The insights will encourage thinking about the many possible situations facing retailers and investors, and by identifying these challenges, how the retail industry can prepare for the future. The first eight insights were launched today at MAPIC the international retail property conference.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Robotics and automation&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP, retailers will increasingly invest in new technology and automation and robotics will change the number of jobs available in the retail sector by 2030. Processes will replace some of the human interface in the retail environment.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;The power of prediction &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As the Internet of Things becomes the new normal, the advanced integration of trillions of connected sensors will provide deeper insights into the buying patterns of consumers, enabling retailers to anticipate consumer requirements before they can themselves allowing the supply chain to become far more refined and efficient. This will allow customers to achieve full transparency about what they’re buying and help retailers to fulfil orders more effectively. &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Buying what you want, where and how you want, is the norm&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Advances in smart device technology allow consumers to literally buy what they see: anywhere, any time. Simple, real–time image capture analysis makes everything &amp;lsquo;shoppable’ from any source.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of UK &amp;amp;amp; EMEA Retail Research at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The future of retail is going to change more than we could ever imagine. At CORE.XP we have taken the time to think about what will change and what it will mean for consumers and the retail industry as a whole. Physical real estate remains important as a sales channel and increasingly as a communicator of the brand and a demonstrator of experience.”&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Other insights from the report include:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Customer experiences are specific not generic&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; - Knowing a customer’s buying habits, their leisure interests, their style and colour preferences means that retailers can present a uniquely personalised experience. Personalization will be the key differentiator in retailing of the future.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Personal ownership of cars has dramatically reduced&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; – The first step on the journey to autonomous vehicles is releasing ourselves from the shackles of the ownership cycle. Personal ownership is the exception rather than the norm. These new vehicles are produced by co-creative partnerships between technology companies and car manufacturers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Stores will become showrooms and brand ambassadors &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;- Physical stores of the future will focus on delivering brand experiences. Shopping has become an immersive, sensory, brand engagement, because, despite the speed and ease of access to online merchandise, the shopper in 2030 still has the desire to visit a physical store. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Pure play (online only) is no longer an important part of retail &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;- Retailers recognise the integral and critical role the physical store has to play. Major pure play retailers will become key owners of physical store real estate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Competition for people’s disposable income has increased&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; - Consumers have a desire for new experiences. Retailers will embrace this making the consumer experience more engaging and educational. Creating a connection with the consumer will be integral to ensuring future success.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
ManpowerGroup Russia &amp;amp;amp; CIS leased 1,575 sq. m in Chaika Plaza VII business-centre which is located in the very centre of Moscow on Novoslobodskaya street, 41. The Landlord of this building is A.N.D Corporation, part of Safmar Group.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Chaika Plaza VII is a Class B+ business-centre which has the total area of 11,300 sq m. and which was commissioned in 2002. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anastasia Fedorova, Property Advisor, Office Department in CORE.XP Russia comments on the deal: &amp;ldquo;We hope that ManpowerGroup will choose CORE.XP to work with its real estate in the future, as it was us who quite quickly found a new quality office space for the Corporation in office portfolio of one of our key developers - A. N. D. Corporation. We were able to achieve the best commercial terms that fully meet the requirements of the two parties.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
REMEDI Clinics leased 990 sq m on the second floor of an administrative building on Shmitovskiy proezd in Moscow. The landlord of this building is Sportproekt Ltd.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The building is in &amp;ldquo;Shell &amp;amp;amp; Core&amp;rdquo; condition. Fit-out works were performed by the clinics itself in accordance with the strict requirements for medical institutions. The new clinics was opened in November 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A little over 4,000 sq m of office premises are still available for rent.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olesya Malakhova, Property Advisor, Offices Department, CORE.XP, said: “It was quite challenging to find perfect premises that meet all the specifics and strict requirements of a medical clinics and Sanitary regulations and standards for medical institutions, as well as a healthy balance of price and quality. We looked at all possible options in Moscow in different locations of the city and eventually stacked to this one. It was very interesting to work with a company engaged in such an important for the Russian medicine function, and we made every effort to find the balance between landlord’s capabilities and tenant’s expectations.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

Healthcare, educational and leisure facilities will all become a fundamental part of the shopping centre, according to new insights from the Future of Retail 2030, by the world’s leading real estate services firm, CORE.XP.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Shopping centre landlords and developers will increasingly start to focus on delivering what consumers want and where they want it and will begin to create integrated communities in which to live, work and shop. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP also foresee that the focus of the traditional fueling stations will change as they become important mini-logistic hubs as sites of fuel retailers will make ideal locations for collection points for online shoppers. Ownership of electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will also become more common and there will be an increased need for fast-charging points, this is especially true for city dwellers without access to a designated parking space or charging point at home.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of UK &amp;amp;amp; EMEA Retail Research at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;It’s all about change. The roles of the shopping centre, of the fuel station, and of retail itself. The speed of change may catch some people unexpectedly, as the mindset and requirements of the consumer will evolve more quickly than the industry can adapt. This means that investors and occupiers need to prepare and be ahead of the changing trends and not wait to adopt them as they happen.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP’s Future of Retail 2030 examines 40 “futurist” insights on how the world of retail will change in the future - amid changes in consumers ‘lifestyles, urban environments, retail operations, logistics and other trends affecting the industry. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP today released the new eight insights from the series of 40 and will reveal the following 24 over the coming weeks.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Other insights outlined by CORE.XP include:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Smartphones will no longer exist but mobile commerce will grow&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As the technology of augmented and virtual reality matures there will be a decrease in the overall dependency on smartphones. Instead smaller and wearable gadgets will connect people to the Internet of Things and will provide access to most information and services. Retailers and landlords will need to prepare to provide digitally enabled environments that can leverage consumers’ connectivity. These environments will need to complement, not compete with consumers’ digital access.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Independent stores and F&amp;amp;amp;B operators will be more prevalent&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Retail destinations will feature unique offerings curated towards the local catchment. Retail chains will recognise the opportunities that exist and will begin to further develop ‘local’ concepts and brand names to give the appearance of independence.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The in-store check-out desk will be replaced by faster cashless ways to pay &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Many retailers have already taken away the physical check-out desk and this is likely to continue as technology will play an increasingly important role as an enabler of retail sales. This will result in a reduction in the number of retail assistants required in this part of the consumer journey.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Fitting rooms will help as opposed to hinder the shopping experience&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Technology will allow customers to try on an outfit in a virtual environment and show items already owned in combination with the item being considered to buy. Fitting room technology will also allow the customer to request a different size or style via touchscreen. This will negate the need to leave the fitting room.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The number of wellness establishments will grow&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The ‘Instagram generation’ will continue to evolve and will have an even greater ‘need’ to look and feel good. Fitness centres will become commonplaces in malls, urban areas and in new-build residential properties.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Retail will be leisure&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As stores become showrooms, in-store leisure elements will dramatically increase. The divide between retail and leisure will become blurred as retail brands address the need for an experience in their store.&#13;

The physical store will focus more on &amp;ldquo;experiences&amp;rdquo;, new emerging brands and changes in lease structures, will play a pivotal role in creating a different shopping experience by 2030. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The new insights from the Future of Retail 2030, by the world&amp;rsquo;s leading real estate services firm, CORE.XP, examines some of the drivers that will change the retail sector by 2030. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Within the next decade, the high street will feature more new emerging brands that are experience-driven and connected with the local community. The trend towards shorter lease lengths and more flexible terms will also contribute towards the changing make-up of the high street as landlords seek to experiment with new brands. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP also foresees that the process and the speed of the returns procedure will be more straightforward. Autonomous vehicles will collect returns from consumers’ homes and selected drop off points. Retailers will create predefined return options in a more progressive way, inclusive of prearranged dates and locations.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Andrew Phipps, Head of UK &amp;amp;amp; EMEA Retail Research at CORE.XP, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The next ten years will be transformative. We’ll see a new version of the high street; people will shop differently and have different expectations around delivery and returns. There will be increased pressure to provide a seamless experience whilst also creating newness and excitement for the shopper.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

CORE.XP’s Future of Retail 2030 examines 40 “futurist” insights on how the world of retail will change in the future - amid changes in consumers &amp;lsquo;lifestyles, urban environments, retail operations, logistics and other trends affecting the industry. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This week, CORE.XP released the new eight insights from the series of 40. The remaining 16 insights will be unveiled over the coming weeks.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The other insights outlined by CORE.XP in the Retail 2030 series include:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Customisation will become the new loyalty&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the social media era, consumers view products as another way to express their individuality. Brands with the ability to tailor products and experiences to meet specific consumer needs are more likely to entice brand advocates and ensure repeat purchases. In the coming years advances in technology and increasingly flexible work systems will create and easier way for companies to customize goods and services in high volumes without significant cost increases. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The sharing economy will be a commonplace&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The size and influence of many shared-economy-based companies now rivals or has exceeded some of the world’s largest companies. Soon many of the world’s most valuable brands will have their roots in the sharing economy and being able to access rather than being able to own will be key. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Curated retail experiences will be a basic expectation&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Today consumers expect greater value propositions in an increasingly competitive marketplace and have expressed that they feel more valued and develop loyalty towards brands that tailor their operations to the consumer’s needs. New technology will support the curated experience and retailers will use the data collected from customer interactions to prompt additional purchases, either at the time of the initial shopping trip or at an appropriate later date. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Delivery tracking information will be precise&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There is still a relatively large delivery window for most items and consumers are leaning towards more precise delivery times if given the option. In the future, the predictive pattern of data will be used more efficient to locate exactly where an item is, allowing consumers to place orders with a high degree of certain delivery time, with accurate estimates given at the time of purchase. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Flexible leases structures will be more common&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There will continue to be proportion of occupiers that request longer leases but this will be in the minority. We’ll see a rise in independent brands embracing the pop-up model in order to offer more personalised services for specific markets and neighbourhoods rather than one large flagship store. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Consumers will be able to experience their purchase before making a payment&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The ‘try before you buy’ will grow to be a common retail experience. Virtual reality and haptic technology will allow people to experience items without buying them. These experiences will feel so realistic that it will allow a “fact”-based decision to be made. &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Technology, economic trends and behavioural changes driving shift towards flexible offices&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investors who successfully adapt products will lead the way for European occupiers &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New office developments likely to incorporate a flexible space element from inception&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 14 December 2017, &amp;ndash; The rise of the flexible office is the result of dramatic changes in the way corporate occupiers approach their real estate decisions, and will open up opportunities for landlords able to adapt and respond to these shifts. These are some of the findings from The Flexible Revolution, a pan-European report from CORE.XP, the world's leading real estate advisor, exploring the flexible office market.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Over the past decade the global flexible office market has been growing at an average of 13% per annum. Growth rates in EMEA (excluding UK) and APAC have averaged around 20% per annum, while the more mature and larger markets of the UK and the USA have seen average growth of 10% per annum over the same period. Key European cities like Berlin, Paris and London have all seen strong year-on-year growth of 12 – 21% between 2016 and 2017, which is comparable with markets like New York and San Francisco, where the flexible office concept has existed for longer.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The main growth drivers have been technology – such as on-demand apps – economic trends such as rising levels of self-employment – and, behavioural changes such as a greater focus on flexible working styles, portfolio agility and the need for quicker go-to-market strategies. In combination with business disruption more generally, these are producing changes in corporate occupiers&amp;rsquo; approach to real estate decision-making, leading to a growing need for flexibility within portfolios.&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  London is the largest market by far, not just in European terms but globally, with over one thousand serviced and co-working centres. The reasons for London’s pre-eminence include the length and relative inflexibility of UK leases, for which flexible offices may provide a solution for occupiers.&#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    The Central London market has seen a diversification in the type of occupiers taking space, including a notable uptick in the amount of space leased to flexible space operators. Demand for flexible space has been fueled by an increase in the number of small businesses in the UK since the recession (22%) and heightened political and economic uncertainty. Recent strong levels of take-up by flexible space operators show no signs of slowing. Demand remains robust with some operators reporting close to 100% occupancy of some centres.&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    New entrants are making their mark on London. A global co-working start-up entered the market in 2014 and has since expanded to over 2m sq ft if space, covering all the main London submarkets, with the majority of offices located in East London near to the &amp;lsquo;Silicon Roundabout’&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    tech cluster. Other co-working focussed operators, many with only one or two centres are springing up to cater to local demand from tech start-ups, including ad-hoc centres operating from cafes such as Forum in Shoreditch and hotels such as The Curtain in the same area, which combines a members’ club and co-working space. Traditional landlords have also reacted; British Land launched its own flexible space brand Storey in 2017, which will operate within its existing London assets. &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    From an investor perspective, the growth in this sector presents opportunities and challenges around market access and valuation. The market is adapting to the change in the way tenants are occupying office space, and there seem to be three models emerging that investors can utilise&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    to access the flexible office market; the traditional lease model, a platform model or a profit/revenue share model.&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    Gavin Morgan, Head of Investor Leasing, EMEA, CORE.XP commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;ldquo;Investors who can successfully adapt their product will be at a distinct advantage when meeting the changing needs of the European occupier community. Whichever model is chosen, there is clearly opportunity for the investor and developer community to create new flexible office products to meet this diverse range of user demands.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    Stewart Smith, Managing Director, Central London A&amp;amp;amp;T, Occupier commented:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    “The rapid growth of the flexible sector can be attributed to fundamental shifts in technology and economy, which has changed how occupiers behave. Each of these in some way is contributing to a structural change in how businesses approach their real estate decisions. The flexible office is here to stay because it addresses the basic occupier need.”&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    The report concludes that the building of the future is likely to move away from the traditional&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    model of all floors being let on conventional lease terms. New developments will incorporate a flexible space element from inception with new buildings marketed as having floors dedicated for this purpose, along with wellness and other shared amenities. This hybrid model mimics the typical growth trajectory of 21st century business – from inception of idea in accelerators right up to the long-term occupation of global corporates – providing landlords with sustainable tenant retention.&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    Pavel Yakimchuk, Head of Fit-out, CORE.XP Russia, said:&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    “Flexible working environment is no longer a novelty in Russia. International corporations, following their international standards, more than a decade ago brought to Russia such concepts as open space, non-fixed workstations, hot desks, etc. Time does not stand still, adding to our vocabular and our life concepts such terms as agile and co-working that marks the beginning of the next stage of real estate market development. This once again proves close relationship with the European market and the fact that we clearly follow international trends, albeit often with a delay.”&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the report, take-up in 2017 (1.28 mn sq m) broke the record of the seven-year period, becoming the highest value since 2010.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2017, 408,000 sq m were commissioned in the Moscow office market. Even though this volume exceeded the previous year by 29%, business construction activity remains low.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2017, overall vacancy rate was reducing by 0.4-0.9 ppts each quarter and by the end of the year amounted to 13.7% (2.7 ppts lower than Q4 2016 value).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Net absorption also showed a positive trend in 2017, reaching 675,300 sq m against 526,900 sq m in the previous year.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2017, financial sector representatives that were mostly companies with state participation or state companies (82% of take-up in the sector) remained active on the office market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Interest in medium-sized office space (33% of take-up in 2017) is one of the indicators of the demand stability and less impact on it of the crisis period effects.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In 2017 a competition between large users for quality space occurred for the first time since 2007 on the office market.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Elena Denisova, Senior Director, Head of Offices CORE.XP in Russia, said: &amp;amp;quot;The recovery process of both the national economy and the commercial real estate market is proceeding at a restrained pace. Nevertheless, for the office real estate market, 2017 was marked by several turning points in terms of further development. One of them is an increase in the activity of private companies for leasing and purchasing new office space. Private business demand, which has been strongly sagged in 2015-2016, coupled with a public sector interest in high-quality offices that is declining but still has significant impact on market indicators led to a record for the market take-up. In addition, the trend to reduce available supply of large office space (more than 10,000 sq m) in the best quality business centres, which began to appear in the middle of 2016, in 2017 for the first time caused the competition of large users for selected premises. This phenomenon has not been observed since 2007, and, like private sector companies&amp;rsquo; restoring activity, is a prerequisite for the rental rates growth in 2018 and the beginning of a gradual shift of the balance towards &amp;amp;quot;landlords&amp;amp;quot; on the office market.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;CORE.XP Research Department indicated the key trends of the Russian regional Industrial and Logistics market for 2017 and gave forecast for 2018.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to the report, key demand drivers in 2017 were companies of different business types. Business activity of e-retailers exceeded its pre-crises level, amounting to 262,000 sq m in 2017.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Annual take-up in 2018 is likely to reach 1.2 - 1.3 mn sq m. There is a number of companies with logistics expansion plans for 2018.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Construction activity in 2018 will remain comparable to 2017 (600 - 700 thousand sq m with BTS construction to account for 55%.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Vacancy will reduce gradually to 9.5 - 10% of total supply.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rental rates will slightly grow by the end of 2018.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;amp;quot;We watched constantly growing demand for warehouse space in 2017, mainly for large and nonstandard projects. A number of major deals were closed last year. At the same time we are seeing renewed development activity. The key market players continue to develop their business, on the one hand, responding to the complex logistic requirements of tenants, on the other hand, reducing the costs of warehouses construction and operation. In this regard interesting customized solutions for large warehouse users at attractive commercial terms become available. Such transactions will be the main driver of market growth in 2018.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets Department, CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &amp;ldquo;Increasing investors&amp;rsquo; activity in Russia, both local and international, resulted in a 3-year maximum investment volume growth  since 2014. The most important trend in 2017 was the closed deals with  international capital - apart from the global and European funds, which were well familiar with the Russian market, investors from Middle East and Asia were very active in 2017. The benchmarking, even the record deals the negotiation of which took for several years, were closed since the beginning of the year.  Expected gradual economic recovery and recovery in all real estate fields became the positive signs for the market players and is expected to result in further investment volume growth.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

Moscow is in the top of the list among the cities that are ready the most to host the games. The largest in 10 years new hotel supply is expected here in 2018. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As of early 2017 there were 650 hotels in Moscow with a total number of 65,000 hotel rooms. About 31,000 of these rooms are the quality room supply, corresponding to international quality standards. In 2017, 8 hotels with a total number of 1,800 rooms opened in Moscow. In 2018 the quality supply of the city is expected to grow by 2,630 rooms. There were 2 quality hotels opened in Moscow in January and February 2018. These were Ibis hotel in Domodedovo and Holiday Inn Express in Sheremetyevo Airport. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The tourist flow analysis showed 14% growth in 2017 Y-O-Y. According to the report more than 19.5 million people visited Moscow in 2017. We expect that over 21 mln people will visit Moscow in 2018 (8% Y-O-Y growth). Tourist interest is coming mostly from European and Latin American fans.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP research, business demand generates up to 70-80% of overnight stays in modern quality hotels in the city. The rest of the overnight stays are for people arriving with tourist purposes.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The market average occupancy level in 2017 was 74%, which is 2 ppt more than in 2016. The market average rate (ADR) also slightly increased &amp;ndash; by 1.9%, was 7,560 RUB. Accordingly, the revenue per available room (RevPAR) increased by 4.4% to 5,446 RUB.&#13;

Moscow, of course, will be the center of the Cup with the largest number of games (12), two stadiums, the opening match and the final. The World Cup will allow Moscow to reach the record tourist flow at of 21 million people. 10 new branded hotels are to be opened at once, two of which have already been opened. Despite 10% growth of quality supply, we expect a positive dynamics of operational indicators of Moscow hotels.

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>Cannes - Moscow, 14 March 2018, &amp;ndash; Industrial, and specifically logistics, is the most sought-after real estate sector for European investors, overtaking office for the first time, according to CORE.XP&amp;rsquo;s annual EMEA Investor Intentions Survey. With the growth of e-commerce continuing to benefit the sector, a third (33%) of respondents in Europe expressed a preference for industrial property, mirroring the trend globally, and reaffirming its status as an institutional asset class. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Across EMEA, office was ranked second, favoured by 26% of respondents, with investors seeking markets with strong economic fundamentals to underpin rental growth and high-levels of liquidity. Residential has seen the steepest rise in popularity, compared to 2017, and was the preferred asset class for 21% of EMEA respondents.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A defining feature of the market last year was the rise in sales of large portfolios, specifically &amp;lsquo;platform’ deals. Notable transactions included Blackstone’s &amp;euro;12.2 billion sale of the Logicor Portfolio to the China Investment Corporation and Brookfield’s $2.8 billion sale of IDI Gazeley to Global Logistics Properties. Not only did the purchasers, typically large Asian investors, access the market at scale, but by buying an operating platform they also acquired the infrastructure and management expertise to manage the assets and continue to develop the portfolio.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jack Cox, Head of EMEA Industrial and Logistics Capital Markets, commented: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;2017 was the year the industrial and logistics sector was unquestionably re-rated, evidenced by the number and scale of platform deals we saw in the sector. Logistics yields remain at a premium over other real estate sectors, and the sustainability of returns in the sector is underpinned by a robust occupational market, which is attracting investors from around the globe.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Driven by aggressive asset pricing and limited availability of core stock, investors globally have become increasingly resourceful in finding innovative ways to deploy capital. In EMEA, 72% of respondents indicated that they were already invested in alternatives and 70% said they were actively pursuing opportunities in the sector. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Alternatives have seen a 45% increase in investment volumes in the last ten years, resulting in €23.6 billion of transactions in 2017. Investors are most frequently targeting student housing (53%), retirement living (38%) and real estate debt (37%); an area where they are looking to increase exposure in 2018. This broadly mirrors the trends we are seeing globally.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In addition to sector preferences, the survey also analysed geographic considerations. Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London were the five most sought-after destinations in Europe for European investors. Paris jumped from fifth to first place, compared to 2017, boosted by expectations that the political and economic momentum from H2 2017 will have a positive impact on the real estate market. London remains the highest priority target for investors outside of Europe and will undoubtedly continue to see the highest volume of investment activity of any European city. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Managing Director, EMEA Investment Properties, CORE.XP: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“While sentiment does not always translate directly into investment volumes, investor preferences do indicate which markets may see heightened activity over the next 12 months. We have seen a shift in sentiment in France for many months now, following the election of President Macron and the subsequent economic momentum this has created. Madrid has seen strong investor interest thanks to improving economic fundamentals. Limited development activity and declining vacancy rates in Amsterdam have boosted its appeal over time. The current strength of the German economy and the lack of supply continue to drive investor demand in all of its key markets.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite 2017 being a record year for real estate investment in Europe, with volumes totaling €291 billion, European investors expect to deploy more capital in 2018 than they did in 2017. A third of EMEA investors (33%) expect to spend more this year than last, compared to 26% last year. At a global level, 45% of investors anticipate committing more capital to real estate. However, as in 2017, availability of product remains a primary concern for investors in 2018, proving to be the biggest obstacle for 34% of European respondents, a challenge that investors are facing around the globe.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Asset pricing has become a key concern for investors, and is even more pronounced than in last year’s survey. Nearly half (44%) of EMEA respondents highlighted it as an obstacle to investment, compared to 38% in 2017. At the same time, the sector continues to appear reasonably priced relative to other asset classes, particularly considering the high-income return and defensive characteristics real estate offers. Competitive pricing of assets is also encouraging some investors looking to sell real estate, with 40% of investors expecting to sell more in 2018 than in 2017. A higher propensity to sell as well as to buy bodes well for market liquidity in 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jos Tromp, Head of EMEA research, CORE.XP, added: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“With limited stock availability, we are expecting to see a continuation of investment activity at a corporate entity level as investors seek to find ways to increase their exposure to real estate. Prime yields are at an all-time low, so investors are looking at alternative asset classes through which to spread their risk, protect themselves against a possible downturn and take advantage of the structural changes that are underpinning demand in these sectors.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The activity of foreign companies in the Russian real estate investment market increased in 2017 – they accounted for 16% of the total annual investment volume. Foreign investments recorded a 4.4 times volume growth in 2017 and 12 percentage points increase compared to 2016. Further increase of the volume of investments into Russian real estate is expected in 2018, including investments from foreign players. This will be facilitated both by improved macroeconomic indicators and the gradual recovery of the real estate market. Office and retail real estate segments remain the most popular among investors in the Russian market.&#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The Investor Intentions Survey was carried out between 26 December 2017 and 24 January 2018. The survey attracted 1,010 respondents globally. This report covers the 350 respondents who indicated to be responsible for investments in EMEA.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The responses were spread across a range of investor types. The most numerous were fund / asset managers, who accounted for 44% of survey participants. Insurance companies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds were responsible for 15%. The other respondents were developers (9%), private equity (7%), private individuals / family offices (7%), listed property companies (inc.

The company has earned a reputation as a first-class theatrical production company focusing on Europe. With offices in the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, France, Italy and the United States, the group produces some of the best-known titles in musical theatre. The company stages licensed productions from its world-renowned partners as well as new, original productions created entirely in-house. Over 7 million visitors attend 50 performances of Stage Entertainment production every year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Stage Entertainment’s business strategy comprises three key activities: producing a wide range of leading international content, including shows like Mamma Mia!, The Lion King, Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Les Mis&amp;eacute;rables, The Phantom of the Opera, War Horse, Mary Poppins, and Wicked; owning and operating a network of musical theatres; and developing new musicals and shows.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In order to ensure world &amp;ndash; class performances, the new theatre centre will accommodate 1,500 spectators and meet the complex technical requirements, primarily to the stage itself.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Stage Entertainment has successful experience of creating a modern theater complex in the center of the Russian capital. In 2012, the former Pushkin cinema gained a new name – Russia - and was redeveloped for a theater. The Little Mermaid new musical performance was the first musical of Stage Entertainment on the new venue (October 6, 2012). The new infrastructure necessary for the modern high-tech musical performances appeared as a result of the complete technical re-equipment of the historic building.&#13;

Marina Malakhatko, Director of CORE.XP Moscow Retail, said: &amp;ldquo;This project to is one of the most interesting for our team in 2018. We will search the market for theatre premises for Stage Entertainment in Moscow. We are looking for both completed platforms with great potential, as well as for the opportunities of a build-to-suit of a stand-alone theater options with further lease and transparent commercial terms that will allow the developer to receive a return on investments in 5-7 years. Our clients, developers of shopping and entertainment complexes, of course, are interested in the theater as a tenant, because it is a reliable partner with an impeccable credit history and guaranteed traffic. Theatre - is also a unique feature for a &amp;amp;quot;superregional&amp;amp;quot; shopping center.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

The new hypermarket will occupy 1,450 sq m on the zero floor of the shopping centre. The first store will be opened in Q2 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The owner of this brand is Placek Group that work for over 30 years in 210 stores in 5 countries (Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia and Poland).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Dino Zoo Pasaule zoo center of about 3,000 sq m was opened in Riga in April 2017. In addition to the actual store, an arena, a veterinary clinic, a grooming salon for dogs and cats, a conference hall and a unique aquarium made of acrylic glass, which is a miniature seaquarium were included in the new concept.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The concept of a new zoo-hypermarket in Kapitoliy Leningradsky in Moscow has no analogues in the Russian market and will repeat the concept of Dino Zoo Pasaule in Riga in many aspects.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Olga Korolevskaya, Consultant, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said: &amp;amp;quot;We are glad that with the joint efforts with ENKA TC and Dino Zoo operator we managed to find a solution to open a large-scale project by Placek Group, despite the fact that high-quality retail space of the required format is quite limited in the Russian market. Interactive stores are being opened in all the segments, where the standard range of products is not the only thing to attract customers. Additional services provided in Dino Zoo stores, will become an entertainment component for the entire shopping center, and will attract children and families, and even the people who do not have pets yet.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In 2017 two branded hotels were opened in St. Petersburg. In December 2017, the hybrid-hotel NETIZEN Saint Petersburg Center for 128 beds had its soft opening. In 2018 two new branded hotels are planned to be opened with 402 rooms in total.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
At the end of 2018, the increase in RevPAR in St. Petersburg will be comparable to 2017 and will amount to about 7% of the market as a whole.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;St. Petersburg is ready to offer its guests an extensive hotel offer in all segments &amp;ndash; from luxury to economy. The World Cup will also contribute to the growing tourist flow into the city. We expect an increase in the number of guests from Europe and Latin America, especially considering that the group stage will include matches with Brazil and Argentina.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Boris Moshensky, CEO of Maris| part of the CORE.XP affiliate network, said: “We should not wait for any records in the hotel real estate segment in the connection with the World Cup. According to forecasts, the tourist flow may increase to 8.2 million people. At the same time, the regular St. Petersburg tourists who are not interested in sports events are likely to postpone their trip to a later date. The World Cup, in general, can create a delayed effect of tourist flow growth when football fans who come to St. Petersburg to watch World Cup in 2018 and will plan a visit the city as regular tourists in the future.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

114 branded hotels with about 6,000 rooms in total operates in Yekaterinburg as of the beginning of 2017. There are about 20 big quality hotels are functioning in Yekaterinburg at the moment which is more than a half of all rooms in this city. Among them are 7 international hotels: Angelo by Vienna House (211), DoubleTree by Hilton (141), Hyatt Regency (293), Liner Airport hotel (149), Novotel Yekaterinburg Centre (168), Park Inn by Radisson (160) and Ramada Hotel &amp;amp;amp;Spa (163). &#13;

Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Yekaterinburg has every chance to demonstrate the growth of RevPAR at the level of 7-10%. This all will be the result of the activation of the event segment in the city: in addition to FIFA World Cup and the traditional July INNOPROM, international judo tournament took place in Yekaterinburg in March, etc.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

According to CORE.XP research, the number of rooms in Nizhniy Novgorod will grow 40% by the beginning of FIFA World Cup 2018.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Over the past three years (2016-2018) the number of rooms in Nizhniy Novgorod increased by 503. 482 more rooms should be opened by the beginning of World Cup (a total of 985 new rooms). At the initial stage of preparation, this figure was more significant &amp;ndash; almost 2 thousand rooms, including even luxury hotels.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Ibis Nizhny Novgorod Stadium Hotel with 242 rooms and DoubleTree by Hilton with 240 rooms – the second hotels in the city, operated by AccorHotels, and Hilton Worldwide will be opened in Nizhniy Novgorod in 2018.&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Nizhny Novgorod is one of those regional cities in Russia where the popularity around World Cup may have negative impact on the performance of the hotel market. Something similar was observed in Yekaterinburg in the connection with SCO in 2008-2009. The city has no potential for demand growth in correspondence with the increasing supply. On the one hand, the branded supply of different categories improves city&amp;rsquo;s image, on the other hand, it will be extremely difficult to open hotels and to reach average rates in accordance with their expected positioning.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;New supply and vacancy rate&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018, the volume of growth in new supply showed an extremely low value and amounted to 37,100 sq m. Office stock within the Third Transport Ring increased by only 5,800 sq m. At the same time, in the current market condition, even such low indicators characterize growth, since completions volume in Q1 2018 was 75% higher compared to the same period in 2017. In January-March 2018, four Class B office buildings were commissioned, the largest of which was the business centre &amp;amp;quot;La-5&amp;amp;quot; near Vnukovo airport.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The limited completions volume will also be common for the following quarters of 2018. Based on the stated plans of developers, the annual increase in quality office space will not exceed 300,000 sq m. Such a low completions volume was observed in 2016 (317,000 sq m) and before that only in 2003 (270,000 sq m) prior to the beginning of the active development of the Moscow office market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The most significant office buildings that are scheduled for commissioning in 2018 are MFC Iskra-Park in the Leningradsky submarket, BC Amaltea in Skolkovo, OKO Phase II in Moscow City, Novion and others. All listed largest declared business centres are Class A buildings, due to which the share of this segment should amount to about 55% in the completions structure in 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Overall vacancy rate continues to decline for the tenth consecutive quarter, beginning in the second half of 2015. According to Q1 results, this indicator decreased by another 1.3 ppts compared with the value at the end of 2017 and amounted to 12.4%. The share of vacant space in Class A segment decreased from 15.7% to 14.1% (by 1.6 ppts lower) for this period, while in Class B the vacancy rate decreased more smoothly, from 12.9% to 11.8% (by 1.3 ppts lower).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;According to our forecasts, in Q2-Q4 2018 the downwards dynamics of overall vacancy rate will continue and will result to decrease of this indicator to 11.5% by the end of the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Demand&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018, take-up amounted to 365,000 sq m of office space. This is a record value of the new transactions volume executed for the first three months of the year since Q1 2010 (375,200 sq m). In January-March 2018, the volume of new leased and purchased by end-users offices increased by 55% compared to the same period in 2017.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018, the volume of renewals and renegotiations fell to 40,000 sq m and amounted to 10% in the total transactions volume, which is one of the factors that confirm the qualitative change in demand and exit from the crisis period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Users demand was still mainly focus on the lease of office premises. This type of transactions is accounted for 83% of take-up in Q1 2018. The volume of sale transactions did not exceed 60,000 sq m. The largest deals were the purchase of one of the buildings in business centre Pallau-RB by the Government of the Moscow Region and the acquisition of office space by Zenith Bank in the business centre Lotus.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018 Class B amounted to 64% in the take-up structure that is 11 ppts below the share of this segment in the same period of 2017. The main volume of leased and purchased office space in Class B was formed at the expense of business centres located in the zone between TTR and MKAD (56% of the new transactions volume in the Class B segment). Class A office premises were in the most demand in the Central Business District, 36% of total Class A take-up was concentrated in this submarket.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018 financial sector companies were the most active tenants and buyers in the office real estate market. They accounted for 21% of take-up both in January-March this year, and in the same period in 2017. The share of companies of leisure, entertainment and retail industry increased by 2 ppts from 13% in Q1 2017 to 15% in Q1 2018. Key deals were executed by such companies as X5 Retail Group, Wildberries, Northern Caucasus Resorts and others.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian companies formed the main demand for office premises both in Q1 2017 and in January-March this year. Their share in the take-up structure amounted to 78% in Q1 2018, compared to 81% in Q1 2017. In the first three months of this year state companies and companies with state participation were active and accounted for 15% of take-up. In Q1 2017, public sector companies formed 5% of the new transactions volume.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The largest share in take-up structure by the size of leased and purchased offices had premises with an area of 1,000-3,000 sq m (28% of new transactions volume), as well as premises with area above 5,000 sq m and less than 500 sq m, whose shares were 25% and 22% respectively. Such distribution indicates demand differentiation and the interest from large, as well as medium and small businesses to the office market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Constraining factors for maintaining business activity and increasing demand in the office market may be a limited choice of suitable options in the face of a declining vacancy rate, as well as risks of geopolitical and economic instability. Nevertheless, according to our forecasts, take-up will reach about 1.25 mln sq m of office space in 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Rental rates&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q1 2018 the average level of rental rates remained in the ranges of the end of last year. The average asking rate for Class A Prime offices amounted to $ 750-850 per sq m per year, excluding operating expenses and VAT, rental rates for Class A premises ranged at 18,000-30,000 RUB/sq m/year and for Class B offices &amp;ndash; 12,000-21,000 RUB/sq m/year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &#13;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;According to our forecasts, rental rates under the influence of a shrinking vacant supply and stable demand will start to increase gradually in the second half of the year, so that the change in the Class A segment by the end of the year may amount to 5-10%, in the Class B segment - 2-3%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
This time hotel experts analyzed hotel market of the most Western city in Russia - Kaliningrad.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP research, a number of quality rooms in Kaliningrad will show almost 2 times increase by the start of FIFA World Cup 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Currently, there are two international hotels in Kaliningrad: Radisson Blu hotel (178 rooms) and economy Ibis hotel (167 rooms). The main supply in the market is presented by local hotels. Local hotels are managed by owners and vary in quality and price. According to the information received from representatives of the hotel market of Kaliningrad, the occupancy of the hotels in the city ranges from 40% to 60% depending on the location of the hotel and the volume of the room stock.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
As of the beginning of 2017, there are 51 hotels with a total room stock of about 2,205 hotel rooms in Kaliningrad. The offer of quality international hotel in the region is limited.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Mercure Kaliningrad hotel of 162 rooms and Holiday Inn of 125 rooms will be opened in Kaliningrad by the start of FIFA World Cup 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;Kaliningrad is one of the most European cities in Russia due to its geographical location and historical past. While business activity in the city is not comparable with the major industrial centers of our country, tourism potential of the region is clearly ahead of the most of other regions. In addition to new quality hotels being opened in the region, it is necessary to stimulate their occupancy by introduction of simplified visa regime, e-visas, promotion of the region in European markets, the development of transport infrastructure, etc. Also the development of the SEZ will be fundamental for the region.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

Total vacant space in Q1 amounted to 1.05 mn sq m, representing a 20% decrease from the end of 2017. Vacancy rate fell to 9.6% of total stock. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
A significant increase in net absorption is observed in Q1 2018, driven by occupying premises previously leased on forward agreements and currently available warehouses.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
402,000 sq m was taken-up in Q1 2018, representing a 2.2 times growth YoY. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Demand is mainly driven by companies expanding their warehouse spaces rather than optimizing the logistics.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP report, total take-up will reach 1.1-1.3 mn sq m in 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Based on the leasing activity and absorption dynamics, vacant space is expected to decrease to 9.2 of total stock by the end of 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anton Alyabyev, Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;We observed a number of positive changes on the market in the beginning of 2018. Both local and international companies were active on the warehouse market, several large transactions were closed in Q1. There are qualitative changes in demand for warehouse &amp;ndash; we observe growing interest to projects customized for specific logistics cases and location. That&amp;rsquo;s why general contract and BTS solutions are in demand.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anastasia Chernoyarova, Analyst of Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;We observe the lowest vacancy level on the market since 2015. Decrease in vacant space is attributable to strong take-up dynamics. The market is becoming more balanced and we observe prerequisites for growth in commercial conditions.”&#13;

 This time hotel experts analyzed hotel market of Volgograd. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 According to CORE.XP research, no new branded hotels will be commissioned in Volgograd before FIFA World Cup 2018. As of the beginning of 2017, there are 85 hotels with a total number of 3,035 rooms in Volgograd. Only three hotels (about 25% of the total number of rooms in the city) operate under international brands. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;FIFA World Cup 2018 will have an extremely positive result for Volgograd. Investment fever did not affect Volgograd&amp;rsquo;s hotel market, where investors were reasonable in estimations of the effect of this event for the city. Among the recently opened branded hotels is Hilton Garden Inn Volgograd of 157 rooms, officially introduced in May 2017. It was decided to open this hotel far before the news about FIFA World Cup. Thus, the quality supply has not increased in this market (not taking into account the apartments of different quality), we expect that this significant sports event will stimulate the growth of tariffs in June and will allow hoteliers to increase the profitability for the whole year.&amp;amp;quot; &#13;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Absolutely new concept for Russia of a bar and a restaurant that also includes large gaming &amp;amp;amp; entertainment zone for kids &amp;amp;amp; adults with bowling, mini-golf courts, snooker tables, amphitheater zones with giant screens to watch sports events, O’Learys was created in Sweden in 1988 and gained popularity across Scandinavia, Europe, Middle East and Asia. There are over 140 restaurants in the world that are being operated by O’Learys franchisees. O’Learys brand was called &amp;ldquo;The franchising system of the year’ in Sweden in 2005 and 2009.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There are the two formats of O’Leary’s restaurants: a large one of from 2,000 – 7,000 sq m with a lounge and gaming zones and sports bleachers that ideally fits into a shopping centre or arena and a classic one of 250-800 sq m and which seats up to 200 people and fits into airports, hotels and railway stations. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Antonio Persson, Chief Development Officer, O’Learys Trademark, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“I’m very pleased to work with CORE.XP as their retail projects are not limited by Moscow, but cover the territory of Russia from the West to Vladivostok. O’ Leary’s brand is one of the strongest among chain restaurants in Europe and I am sure that Russian customers will like the new format as much as the customers of the Mall of Scandinavia in Stockholm where we have our 7,000 sq m flagship restaurant. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
We will open our first restaurant in Russia at Sheremetyevo International Airport before World Cup and we are very excited to explore the opportunity to enter the Russia market&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Alexandra Chirkaeva, Head of Moscow Retail Leasing, Moscow Retail Department, CORE.XP, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Launching O’Leary’s in Russia is very much in time. With FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games and a general trend when shopping centres more and more become a place for leisure and entertainment, I am sure that Russian franchisees will be able to truly appreciate all the benefits of working under O’Leary’s trademark. Besides, for the moment, it is an absolute niche and Russia doesn’t have any other sports bar and event center of such scale.“&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;According to CORE.XP research, only 3 branded international hotels will be operated in Rostov-on-Don during FIFA World Cup 2018. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rostov-on-Don&amp;rsquo;s hotel market was developing more slowly in comparison with other regional cities of Russia. The first hotel operated by international brand &amp;ndash; Mercure (89 rooms) was opened there in 2014.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Radisson Blu hotel for 82 rooms was opened in Rostov-on-Don in 2018 after its complete reconstruction. The third hotel in Rostov-on-Don, operated by international brand is Ramada Hotel &amp;amp;amp; Suites with 92 rooms.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Courtyard by Marriott Rostov-on-Don for 200 rooms near Rostov Arena stadium might be commissioned in the city by the end of 2018. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As of the beginning of 2017, there are 103 hotels with a total number of 3,014 rooms in Rostov-on-Don. Only 25 of them (about 65% of the total number of rooms in the city, including mini-format) are the quality ones.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;Five years ago, after the announcement of all hotel projects in Rostov-on-Don, a dangerous situation could arise for the market, with the almost simultaneous introduction of new hotels, including several projects of luxury segments. It didn't happen before FIFA World Cup due to different circumstances. The hotels introduction is gradual, which has a positive effect on market performance. However, there are at least three branded projects at different stages of completion. The hotels will be commissioned within the next year and a half or two. The total number of rooms will be more than 550 rooms. It should be noted that all existing international players in the market have less than 100 rooms. It is obvious that the commission of new hotels in the middle price segment with the big number of rooms can have a negative impact on the average rate of all hotels in the city.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Tremendous work has been done in Rostov-on-Don to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of a new airport Platov, capable to accept all types of airplanes, which will increase passenger traffic, and thus increase the potential number of guests. In addition, the airport is located far from the city center, which makes one day business trips to the city  quite difficult. So this can increase the length of stay in the city for the guests. International players feel confident and look forward to FIFA World Cup 2018. Some of the rooms which were booked by Match Accommodation were cancelled in April, but the hotels were able to fill the vacant rooms.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London - Moscow, 16 May 2018 &amp;ndash; Retail brands continued to open new stores in a wide range of cities globally in 2017, indicating that the physical store remains fundamental to retailers&amp;rsquo; omnichannel strategies and are increasingly important to retailers’ success in international markets, according to CORE.XP’s annual report &amp;lsquo;How Global is the Business of Retail?&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
CORE.XP’s latest report identified that 123 cities had at least one new global retail brand open for the first time and of the brands expanding into new markets, 41% targeted more than one city. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Global retailer expansion across the EMEA region was mainly dominated by Coffee &amp;amp;amp; Restaurants (F&amp;amp;amp;B) and Mid-Range Fashion retailers such as Arket, Reserved and Tim Hortons. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Globally, the Coffee &amp;amp;amp; Restaurant category was a key driver of global retail expansion in 2017, and accounted for 25% of new market entrants, up 17% from 2016. Activity in F&amp;amp;amp;B sector has been driven by the evolution of consumer shopping habits and a preference for experiential retailing. This has been a key driver of expansion as landlords continue to diversify their tenant mix with more experience-orientated brands. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong has once again claimed the top spot as the most targeted city for new retail entrants attracting 86 international retail brands in 2017. Dubai follows Hong Kong with 59 new entrants, with Dubai also taking the coveted top spot to become the number one city for the most international retailers present with 62%. Dubai also remains a key stepping stone for global retail and consumer brands entering the Middle East region. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the uncertainty associated with Britain’s decision to leave the EU, the UK featured third with 54 new retail brands opening a store for the first time in 2017. London reinforced its continuing global retail appeal and attracted 49 new retailers, which saw London take the top spot as the most sought-after retail destination amongst the European cities, and ranked fourth in the top 20 global cities for new global and consumer retail entrants. Two major global brands to open in London last year were Canada Goose and Sonos. F&amp;amp;amp;B and luxury brands were the biggest drivers of new store openings in London and accounted for 33 of the new retail entrants.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Taipei (52), Tokyo (46) came in third and fifth place respectively to make up the rest of the top five most attractive cities for new retailer openings. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
David Close, Head of Retail Occupier EMEA, Advisory &amp;amp;amp; Transaction Services, at CORE.XP, commented:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Retailers have approached expansion with caution and as a result this has led to a slowdown in growth in some markets. Expansion is still key but many retailers are reviewing their store portfolios and consolidating their stores before focusing on international expansion. The retail sector has evolved and the way consumers shop has changed but physical store expansion remains a key element to a retailer’s success. In today’s evolving retail world, retailers must create a seamless integration between consumers’ online and offline experiences. Having a comprehensive online strategy is also a significant factor for many retailers and omnichannel strategies can help boost the need for a physical store and many pure play retailers have signaled this through their expansion into brick-and-mortar locations.&amp;rdquo; &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The report also reveals that European cities are the preferred destination for global retailer expansion attracting 41% of new retail entrants in 2017. This is largely attributed to European retailers continuing to focus their expansion plans in their domestic region.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Natasha Patel, Director, Global Retail Research, added: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Innovation in technology and economic changes are continuing to have an impact on the retail industry. As retailers look to raise their brand profile, they are still looking to expand and having a global store network remains crucial to their success. Mature markets remain at the forefront for retailer expansion despite concerns about some of them experiencing distress. Although expansion has slowed, these tried and tested global locations will remain high on retailers’ agenda for expansion.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Marina Malakhatko, Director of CORE.XP Moscow Retail, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Russia remains one of the most attractive countries for business development for retailers. And it is in top ten countries for retailers in our ranking.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Among European cities, Moscow is the third after London and Prague, however, the main competitors for the Russian capital are Asian megalopolises, such as: Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore and the last years’ newcomers, the Middle Eastern cities, such as Dubai and Doha.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Most active retailers in EMEA are F&amp;amp;amp;B retailers, Mid-Range fashion and shoes, electronics and home goods. At the same time, Moscow market only partially reflects these trends: 15 Mid-Range fashion and shoes brands and 6 electronic brands have entered the market. “&#13;

This time hotel experts analyzed hotel market of Samara.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The first five-star hotel Lotte and the largest stadium &amp;ldquo;Samara arena&amp;rdquo; of 156,000 sq m for 45,000 guests were opened in Samara because of FIFA World Cup 2018.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to CORE.XP research, as of the beginning of 2017, there are 111 hotels in Samara (including micro-hotels) with a total of about 3,000 hotel rooms. Only 25% of the total number of rooms in the city are the quality ones. The rest are represented by private mini-hotels, as well as hotels of Soviet construction.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
There were only 2 international hotel brands in the city for quite a long period of time: Renaissance hotel (196 rooms), opened in 2003 as well as Holiday Inn (177 rooms), opened in 2007. The first 5 star hotel was opened in Samara in 2018 especially for the World Cup.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: “The market will definitely revive during the championship. It is obvious that opening of luxury Lotte hotel in Samara will improve the image of the city as a whole. However, in our opinion it will be extremely difficult to achieve the expected operational results in accordance with its positioning.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Anton Alyabyev, Senior Director, Head of Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Logistics Department, CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;amp;quot;Regional markets become more and more interesting for developers in Russia. This is primarily due to the fact that during the whole last year and in early 2018 we saw a lack of quality warehouses stock. This deficit of vacancy has a positive impact on commercial terms &amp;ndash; the average rental rates in I&amp;amp;amp;L segment in large regional markets are comparable, and sometimes exceed the rates in Moscow and Moscow region markets. In 2018, we expect a stable demand dynamics in the regions and an increase in development activity.&amp;rdquo; &#13;

Pavel Barbashev, the Director of Asset Management and Leasing at O1 Properties, said: &amp;ldquo;White Square remains one of the most prestigious business developments in Moscow, and is a favored choice for companies, which need to be at the heart of business life. A prestigious office upholds brand reputation and can be a key advantage in attracting the best staff, which is particularly important for companies at the forefront of new product development.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

Although many companies are moving their offices outside the Third Transport Ring, which bounds the central district, a central location remains of paramount importance for large international and Russian companies. Samsung has made the right choice by placing its Artificial Intelligence Center in White Square, which is one of the most prestigious business sites in Moscow.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Net absorption in January-June 2018 amounted to 436,000 sq m. This volume is 4 times higher compared to H1 2017 and indicates a high activity of tenants and buyers on the Moscow office real estate market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q2 2018 overall vacancy rate continued to decline and reached 11.6%. The pace of reduction is accelerating.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In Q2 2018, the volume of completions remained at a low level. Based on the plans of developers, in 2018 completions volume will be 2 times lower YoY and amount to about 215,000 sq m. In 2019, the new supply volume is expected to increase to 350,000 sq m.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

</value></field><field name="PREVIEW_TEXT_TYPE"><value>html</value></field><field name="DETAIL_PICTURE"/><field name="DETAIL_TEXT"><value>London &amp;mdash; Moscow, June 5, 2018 —Hong Kong Central remained the most expensive office market in the world with London&amp;rsquo;s West End taking second place, according to CORE.XP’s annual Global Prime Office Occupancy Costs report. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Nine of the top-10 most expensive locations are the same as last year, but London (City) returned after a brief hiatus, with overall prime occupancy costs at US$145 per sq. ft, displacing Shanghai (Pudong) for the 10th spot. Meanwhile London’s West End reached prime occupancy costs of US$235 per sq. ft.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Kevin McCauley, Head of London research at CORE.XP said: &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Helped by sterling’s appreciation against the U.S. dollar, the return of London (City) to the ranking reflects robust and diversified tenant demand and relatively limited new supply. London’s attraction to both UK and international businesses means that it will continue to command some of the highest office costs in the world.&amp;rdquo;&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Hong Kong Central’s overall prime occupancy costs of US$3299,89 per sq. m. per year topped the “most expensive” list, followed by London West End (US$2529,63 per sq. m.), Beijing Finance Street (US$2162,58 per sq. m.), Hong Kong Kowloon (US$2 040,41 per sq. m.) and Beijing Central Business District (US$2 039,12 per sq. m.). &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Global prime office occupancy costs—which reflect rent, plus local taxes and service charges for the highest-quality, “prime” office properties—rose 2.4 percent year-over-year, with the Americas up 3.2 percent, EMEA up 2 percent and Asia Pacific up 1.7 percent. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“For the first time in this cycle, prime office occupancy cost growth was consistent across all regions,” said Richard Barkham, global chief economist, CORE.XP. “Global economic growth has stimulated robust leasing activity, particularly in EMEA and APAC. While occupancy cost growth in the Americas slowed slightly compared to a year earlier, it remains the region with the overall largest increase in costs. We expect global office occupancy costs to increase by approximately 2 percent in the year ahead.” &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Durban, South Africa, fueled by strong demand from business-process outsourcing companies, had the highest increase in year-over-year occupancy cost overall, followed by Bangkok, Marseille, Vancouver Downtown and Oslo. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Vancouver Downtown showed the largest increase in the Americas, followed by Downtown Manhattan, Toronto Downtown, Los Angeles Suburban, Midtown South Manhattan and Dallas Downtown. Costs in Midtown South Manhattan reached an all-time high as strong demand for premium space continued. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Asia Pacific, Bangkok had the highest growth, followed by Hong Kong Kowloon, Singapore, Melbourne and Wellington. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Durban, Marseille, Oslo, Stockholm and Berlin led EMEA in occupancy cost growth. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Dubai, Shanghai Puxi, Midtown Manhattan, Moscow and Abu Dhabi saw the largest decreases year-over-year. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The top ten leaders of the world’s most expensive cities in terms of the prime occupancy costs remained almost unchanged for many years. Moscow with a value of US$1163.54 per sq m per annum is on the 14th place (the indicator includes the base rental rate, operating and maintenance costs and VAT).&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“The dominant trend among markets with notably rising prime occupancy costs is strong demand from the finance, technology and e-commerce sectors,” said Dr. Barkham. “Markets with declining occupancy costs are primarily affected by supply/demand imbalances resulting from new completions. Since reduced costs due to excess inventory tend to be relatively short-lived, companies looking for space in those markets should move quickly.”&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Anna Shepeleva, Director, Research Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“Traditionally, Moscow was included in the top-10 of the rating, however, since early 2014, the position of the Russian capital city has decreased from the 5th to the 14th, partly because of switching to the rental rates nomination in Russian rubles. However, we see a high activity in the office real estate market in Moscow: according to preliminary data for the first half of 2018, the net absorption of Class A and B offices in Moscow increased 4 times compared to the same period of 2017. We expect that rental rates under the influence of a vacancy rate reduction may show an increase in 2018-2019, which can be 5-7% for Class A, for Class B - 2-3%.”&#13;

According to the report, 13 new international brands entered Russian market in H1 2018 and 3 left it. The number of new brands is 10 less than in 2017.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
5 brands have already announced new store opening plans: Coach, О&amp;rsquo;Learys, Flormar, Dino Zoo and COS. Many brands, already present on Russian market plan to open new stores. Among them are: McDonalds, Burger King, Under Armour, LC Waikiki, Metro Cash&amp;amp;amp;Carry and OBI. Ikea and Leroy Merlin, simultaneously with big formats, started developing new compact &amp;ldquo;showroom&amp;rdquo; format stores and already opened their first new format stores. It is worth noting that positive brand dynamics is expected in the second part of 2018&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Despite the reduction in the number of foreign brands that entered the Moscow market in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period of the previous year, “Caf&amp;eacute; and Restaurants” category has been actively developing. Besides international retailers, Russian gastromarkets open new restaurants (Vokrug Sveta, StrEAT, and others). It’s share in new openings increased by 2 pp to 7%. &#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After the decline in new shopping center opening in 2017, developers activity is growing as a result of adaptation to new terms of financing. 15 shopping centres with total GLA of 312,100 sq m are expected to be opened in 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average vacancy rate will continue decreasing to 7.5-8.0% by the end of 2018, on the background of low new delivery.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Significant share of new delivery in 2018 (48% of GLA) will be located outside MKAD, including 32% in Moscow region. That is caused by limited land plots availability inside MKAD, active construction of new housing, new transport interchange hubs and transport traffic growth, related to that, seen outside MKAD. Average leasable area of new shopping center openings in 2018 will decrease by 31% to 20,800 sq m, compared to 2017. Outlet format will be actively developing in 2018-2019.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CORE.XP forecasts retail prime rental rate inflationary growth of 4-6%, amounting to 208,000 – 212,000 RUB/sq m/year, by the end of the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
Aleksandra Chirkaeva, Head of Moscow Retail Leasing, CORE.XP Moscow Retail Department, said:&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
“One of the significant events of the restaurant market in H1 2018 was the opening of Vokrug Sveta gastro market in Nikolskaya Plaza, which provided the opening of 24 corners of famous Russian restaurateurs. Excellent results in terms of speed shows and StrEAT, opened at the end of last year in Roomer. This format will continue to develop in the future. Russian restaurateurs have opened more than 60 restaurants in total in high and medium price categories since the beginning of the year Moscow. Along with the high dynamics of opening of low-cost places we can say that level of entrepreneurial activity in this segment remains and we see the prospects of growth of consumption of the Moscow retail market as a whole.“&#13;

 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 CORE.XP analytics recorded a 2-year maximum transactions volume on the Moscow region warehouse market. Total area of H1 2018 transactions amounted to 684,000 sq m, indicating a 38.7% growth compared to previous year performance. There is a stable demand on customized warehouse solutions – built-to-suit projects account for 17% of total H1 deals. &#13;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Logistics company PEK leased 20,000 sq m in Adamant warehouse.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#13;
 Distribution and retail companies have been most active on the warehouse market in H1 2018. FMCG &amp;amp;amp; food and alcohol prevailed significantly in take-up structure by goods type. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 At the same time, 134,000 sq m was commissioned in Q2 2018. Half-year completions account for only 68% of H1 2017 volume. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 Total vacant space amounted to 1,015 sq m. Vacancy rate decreased to 9.1% of total stock.  &#13;

  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;High business activity both in demand and construction will maintain on the warehouse market in H2 2018: &#13;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Given the previous quarters take-up dynamics. Total construction in 2018 is expected to reach 720,000 sq m. 66% of delivery represent speculative projects.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Total annual 2018 demand is likely to reach 1.1-1.3 mn sq m, &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Based on demand and absorption forecasts, we expect by the end of 2018 total vacancy to account for 10.1% of warehouse stock. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;
   &#13;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Commercial terms are likely to stay the stable. An increase in rental rates is possible on the submarkets with low vacancy levels. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#13;

 Anton Alyabyev, Senior Director of Warehouse &amp;amp;amp; Industrial Department, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
 &#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
 &amp;ldquo;In the first half of 2018 we saw a record high demand in 2 years on the Moscow region warehouse market. Take-up mostly represents long-term lease deals with Russian companies, expanding their warehouse capacity. At the same time, major development companies are becoming interested in speculative projects due to stable commercial conditions and gradual vacancy reduction.“ &#13;

&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Tatiana Belova Associate Director, Head of Hospitality &amp;amp;amp; Tourism group CORE.XP in Russia said: &amp;ldquo;The World Cup had a different impact on the two Russian capitals. In terms of advertising direction and image of Russia as a whole, the effect, of course, was stunning. But if Moscow fully felt the positive impact of the championship, the results for the hotel market of St. Petersburg can be called contradictory &amp;ndash; in June last year the Northern capital &amp;amp;quot;did&amp;amp;quot; more both in terms of occupancy and rates. This year ordinary tourists preferred to refrain from trips to St. Petersburg during FIFA World Cup. &#13;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
  The law, which allows foreigners who hold FIFA World Cup 2018 fan passports to visit Russia without a visa until December 31, 2018, will be able to attract additional tourist flow. At the same time, it is worth saying that many of those who visited the Cup were budget travelers who unlikely could afford to return to the capital again this year. In our opinion, the further introduction of fan passport initiative – will be fruitful for other mass events, for example, for the European football championship, planned in St. Petersburg in 2020, and not only.&#13;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
      &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
    Russia has been able to show hospitality, exposing many of the myths about yourself and appealing to foreign tourists. We hope that the world championship gave a boost and if the issues with obtaining a visa will be resolved and simplified, in the next couple of years we will see the growth of the tourist flow from the West.“&#13;

Marina Malakhatko, Director of CORE.XP Moscow Retail, said: &amp;ldquo;Smolensky Passage 2 - is a long-awaited project for the entire market, and for me personally, because we have finally found an ideal platform for the realization of a long-standing dream - a premium format of the retail concept in a modern interpretation. Arbat district is characterized by the highest level of cost per square meter in Moscow: the average price is 525,000 rubles/ sq m. More than five thousand people with a very high income live within a radius of three kilometers. The business environment is represented by Class A office centers, including Smolensky Passage 1 and 2, Lotte Plaza, a variety of government organizations, embassies and foreign offices. The average salary in the area is 123,000 rubles per month. In addition, the location of the project next to the key luxury hotels of the city, such as Radisson Royal, Golden Ring, Lotte Hotel allow to count on the growth of tourist flow and, as a result, high sales in the first and second phases. Thanks to the joint efforts with the developer's team, we intend to create the most fashionable premium platform that combines the latest trends in fashion industry and services.&amp;rdquo;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
According to H1 2018 results build-to-suit projects take a significant part in Moscow office supply structure. Despite a slight decline in public sector activity in the office sales market in the first half of 2018, the activity of large companies with state participation remains high and the demand is formed by build-to-suit projects. The purchase of Class A and B offices in H1 2018 is amounted to 74,000 sq m, 10% of the total volume of transactions in H1 2018. In H1 2017 this figure amounted to 33,700 sq. m.&#13;

Alexander Pyatin, Director of Sales &amp;amp;amp; Acquisitions, Office Department CORE.XP in Russia, commented: &amp;amp;quot;Although the volume of the existing supply is able meet the needs of potential buyers,number of projects with large vacant blocks for sale in the developed business districts is actively reducing. This will become a driver for strengthening the existing price expectations and their growth in the future.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Yekaterinburg heads the list of cities with the population of over 1 mln people in terms of quality office supply. The total quality office stock there is 495,000 sq m.

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Total office stock in these cities is limited to 2.2 mn sq m, which is comparable to the volume of quality supply in St. Petersburg, but 6.9 times less than the quality office stock in Moscow.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The largest volume of new construction is located in Yekaterinburg (up to 86,000 sq m), Novosibirsk (up to 29,000 sq m) and Perm (up to 17,000 sq m). Also there are business centres under construction in Kazan, Volgograd and Voronezh. At the same time there are no office projects under construction in Rostov-on-Don, Samara and Ufa.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Against the background of low completions volume in Yekaterinburg, the vacancy rate declined by 2 p.p. and amounted to 5%. Also, a decrease in the vacancy rate by 1 p.p. occurred in Nizhniy Novgorod and Kazan with 2.3% and 6.3% accordingly. This influenced rental rates growth.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;

The new office occupies the 3rd and half of the 2nd floors at ARCUS III business-centre, which is located at Leningradskiy prospect, 37A k4. &#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The new office occupies 3,400 sq m. Throughout the course of the project, CORE.XP conducted technical audit of the tenant&amp;rsquo;s future premises, as well as provided a full range of fit-out works management services later on.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The total leasable area of ARCUS business complex is over 34,000 sq m, and ARCUS III is a modern 15-storey Class A business-centre, a part of this complex. A distinctive feature of Arcus III is its green concept. The building, where the new office of GSK Pharma is based, is officially certified by the international sustainability association - BREEAM.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The green concept was also implemented in the company's office premises, where the &amp;ldquo;Tunable White&amp;rdquo; technology was used, which enables automatic change of the lightning intensity during the day, reducing power consumption and promoting staff wellbeing.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The concepts of “Smart Working” was also implemented at the company's office, meaning that the working stations are not assigned to the particular employee and all personal belongings are stored in personal lockers rather than at the work stations, allowing the introduction of alternative workstyles leading to increased staff interaction and productivity.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The company moved to a new office in May 2018. The fit-out project lasted for 4 months.&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Pavel Bolotnikov, Associate Director, Head of Fit-out, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;From the very beginning, the project team faced an ambitious task of implementing a unique project with key features, both in terms of engineering support and in terms of overall organization of the office space. One of the key roles in the successful implementation of the project was the effective project management from the Client’s side, when the expertise and the involvement of key representatives of the Client helped us resolve all issues promptly, and all the decisions were made in the most effective way. In general, all the participants of the project showed themselves as high-level professionals, who were ready to set ambitious goals and solve the problems of any complexity. &amp;amp;quot;&#13;

&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Looking at the 12-month trend, investment volumes are broadly flat compared to the same period in the previous year and the market continues to perform at near-record levels.&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Real estate investment in Germany and France remained strong. Germany continued to experience robust growth and recorded an increase of 12% compared to 2017, and saw investment volumes reach €19.5 billion. This has been primarily driven by a strong residential market, up 38% year-on-year, and office sales in the top five German cities. Similarly, France has remained resilient posting €4.7 billion for Q3 2018 and taking year-to-date investment volumes up 18% to €19.2 billion. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In the UK, investment transaction volumes reached €18.5 billion, a slight decline on the same period last year. Central London office transactions continued to drive investment volumes across the UK as the office market remains attractive to global investors. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
The continued strength of the industrial sector reflected another notable quarter, and reached above €7 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, taking year to date investment volumes to €22.5 billion. Alternatives, including healthcare, leisure and parking, also remained resilient, with investment volumes increasing by 8% in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the same period in the previous year. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Against a backdrop of uncertainty for the retail sector, European retail investment volumes reached €10.8 billion in Q3 and contributed to an increase of 5% in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Jonathan Hull, Managing Director of Investment Properties, EMEA at CORE.XP, commented: &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;ldquo;Continental Europe has posted robust investment numbers for Q3 showing the strength of demand across all major markets. Whilst European institutional demand remains strong, international capital continues to target the European market. We have seen particularly strong demand from Korean institutions across the region. Looking forward to the end of the year we anticipate that investor demand and capital allocations to commercial real estate will remain strong reflecting investor confidence in the asset class.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
Irina Ushakova, Senior Director, Head of Capital Markets, CORE.XP in Russia, said:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
&amp;amp;quot;In the Russian market in Q1-Q3 2018 the most tangible investment volume growth occurred in the residential segment. In January-September of this year developers invested about $660 mln in residential development sites, which is 26% higher than in the same period of 2017. At the same time, the share of this segment in the structure of investments increased by 11 p.p. - from 20% in the first 9 months of 2017 to 31% in the same period of this year. This change is caused by the desire of developers to acquire and negotiate the project before introducing amendments into the law. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Q1-Q3 2018, the volume of investments in the office segment decreased 1.6 times compared to the value for Q1-Q3 2017, and amounted to $440 mln or 21%. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;

The share of investments in retail real estate remained at the same level and accounted for 21% in January-September 2018, the same as in Q1-Q3 2017. However, the volume of investments in this segment decreased by 16% to $460 mln. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
In Q1-Q3 2018 the share of investments in multi-functional complexes accounted for 13%, in industrial real estate - 10% and in hotels - 4% of total investment volume. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#13;
  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&#13;
We expect that investment volume in real estate in Russia will reach $4 bln in 2018, whereas the recovery of demand in the commercial real estate markets and moderate economic growth will contribute to a possible investment volume increase in 2019.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
